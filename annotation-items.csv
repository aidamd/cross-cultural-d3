"Interesting reasoning. No doubt you feel we should apply it in cases of human suffering as well. When disasters strike, when famines hit, when wars are afoot... if there's too many victims to treat them all humanely, we should euthanize them. Right?"

A blue wall ?How about Trump finally has to face some educated voters ?

iski99: The statement you quote is quite stunning and it's even more startling that about one-third of Canadians don't appear troubled by this at all. You have to wonder how much more of this government Canadians can tolerate.

You're likely right... but will there be any evidence?

You are just silly. Not a word of what you said has any merit.
Says the opinion collected from voters at the advance poll and the strong trend toward registered democrats among the mail in ballots. None have been counted but it is a trend that favours the Democrats.
Imagine that he had to bow to absolute spectacles such as the always rabid and frothing at the mouth Pierre Polievre who was rewarded for his obnoxiousness with cabinet minister positions. Must have been a kick in the teeth.

Well I call him Mr. Senategate this week not the Emperor. Harper is fishing for consumer votes with the EU. Prices will stay the same as no one will pass on the savings to consumers.
That line is really getting stale chirp.
His emphasis was on 'small'. Sorry you missed it.

Liar. The actual number is 17.5%. See: http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/as-sa/98-314-x/98-314-x2011001-eng.cfm
I used to think the WHO was a responsible organization. I used to think the Cancer Society actually wanted to cure cancer. I used to think there was no such thing as corruption. I used to think the Globe and Mail was a reputable newspaper.
"100% accurate, unfortunately the liberal propaganda team will have this comment deleted like every other post that doesn't praise their god."
Much ado about nothing. In the grand scheme of things this hardly rates. All governments are corrupt. Only the degree of corruption is open to debate.
Wrong!
"We elect governments that do not allow the 'market' to operate, we've been raised to be socialists."

"Correct thing'? Maybe for people like you who have been out to get the PM from day 1, but not for me, nor for anyone else who can see clearly."
Are you stuck in the 1950s?
"I'm all for black people expressing their grievances, but what has Gay Pride to do with those concerns? Gay people are not the ones oppressing blacks."
What was with Harper's use of the phrase 'old stock Canadians'? Sounds a lot like the 'pure laine' reference by extreme nationalists ion Quebec. A strong whiff of racism in that phrase. Too many Canadians not WASP enough for you Steve?
The appearance of Con support can be chalked up to cheating.
"Harper censored all scientists, a far greater offense, and basically got a free pass."
The G&M is a right-wing rag that gets called leftist whenever Simpson speaks the truth.
"yes, I agree, Canada should give up its' thousands of nuclear weapons./sarc"
Perhaps you should care about Tienanman Square if you are Chinese.

Well since I am smarter than you are. I understand that anti-Canadian movement of the left have done everything they could stop all pipelines from Alberta. Now go back and join your anti-Canadian movement and continue stopping any and all projects.
So why is Trudeau also falling into line? Is he as dumb and naive as everyone says he is? It appears that you think so.
"With that attitude, you must work on Obummer's White House, eh?"
Pure drivel. But keep believing yourself!
If there is anything the Press is very familiar with its the gutter.
Try actually reading the article.
"A weird bit of illogic. Every citizen gets one vote, not many - obviously. You vote where you are obligated to register, which is where you live, or as an expat, last lived. Is that hard for you to understand?"
Never trust anyone who predicts the future with such certainty. This article and woman are examples of why the British want and need to leave. Another globalist rant about how your average person is too stupid and inept to govern themselves.
Nonsense .. The U.K. wants the right to control its borders . If Germany wants to bring in millions of Arab migrants than go ahead but don't force the UK to feel the same
Media monkey!
Another dear leader that is more concerned with holding onto power than doing what is right for his nation. Reminds me of Rob Ford.
Hardly. Gibson is a life long Liberal with a capital 'L'.You certainly do not know Mr. Gibson.

"I suspect at least 40% of Canadians agree with you Bud. When a sober decision is made at the ballot box on Oct 19, 2015 there is only one serious option. Its the PM."
More like Trudeau's Fanzine.
I am willing to bet that the other common factor is that they are all poor.
"I tend to agree. The biggest problem, as stated in the article, is that the union won't even discuss an evaluation process. Just mention it and we get a strike. Our kids are being held for ransom."
"No, every Con played up the Liberal problems, like poor drunk Ralph Klein squalling about the NEP and transfer payments. Even as PM Harper played up the NEP. And the dumber members of Canadian society fell for it every time."
"If you smell anything like you look, no wonder you have to spend most of your time posting on internet forums"
"Mr Simpson is disingenuous. He fully well knows that Parliament really does not exist in Canada. It has been fully castrated by the PMO, which is the real ruler."
"500, 000 unemployed in Ontario. 170, 000 in Alberta and so on . Why don't you go there and put those people to work?"
The only racism displayed is your tolerance of old world sexism towards women.
Sarcasm at its finest - well done.
"--well, --not_quite_no influence. Just enough to make us raise our hackles at the absurdities published at 'the Centre-of-the-Universe' in its' sublime ignorance of what's west of Lake Superior."

"Mark Shore - thanks for the context, that's very helpful. LoonerLander - your input is great. Not everyone would get around the censors with a llama manure reference ya know..."
"Instead of stopping people from taking the own lives why don't we actually address the elephant in the room for once? Why are so many people finding life so unbearable they chose to end it and what as Canadians can we do to help our friends, neighbors and our children."
A hateful Christian is an oxymoron
What a poorly written article. Does not say much for the University of Calgary. Like Harper he uses division for political gain.
Neo-Left Statistics - 60% voted against Tory remember how many times sore loser leftists whined that 60% voted against Harper 53% voted against Ford so now we throw the whine back in their faces 60% voted against Tory

"All true, but the real 'why' is that the others were loyal Canadians, while Harper is a traitor engaged in treason."
If you honestly see the deceitful Cons as the 'best option' available I feel sorry for you.
Straw man argument. Your wife doesn't pay income tax because she has no income. Sutherland make millions of dollars annually and pays no Canadian taxes on his income. Obvious.
"Shia are not promoting international terrorism. I would even question if paying for the funeral of those murdered by Israel is really terrorism, but since criticizing Israel is verboten, many believe it to be so."
What a specious arguement. Are you suggesting that they wouldn't have freezed if those jets were parked?
"Union membership is NOT a requirement of employment. You've never heard of the term ""Rand formula"" employee? Look it up."
"Actually, the Central Canadian elites care more about bringing refugees into the country at the cost of several billion than helping our own Canadians first."
"Harper is the Prime Minister for only the 30% of us who still somewhat agree with his prejudices. For the rest of us (including the Chief Justice), he is content to be our Dictator, who will do anything to dictate his orders."
"Stop it Avi, you're not supposed to comment on your own column."

My guess is that Harper is more like Nixon than we realize - I bet that all PMO offices were bugged (audio and video) as well as all email and computer files regularly scanned and reported on. Harper is sick enough to set this up.

Ha. Good point on the cross; plain low grade masochism (turban) vs. gruesome and brutal sadomasochism (cross).
Are you saying no one in Canada has ever been attacked by wildlife?

"Is that a Drumpf endorsement, Ravensbud ?"
Harper Conservatives are nothing if not radicals. Extreme in everything. Everyone else is either a terrorist or a child pornographer.
Mr. Walllace please check your false assumptions.
And that fcker McGuinty committed us to 80 cent per kilowatt hour solar!!! What an absolute POS.
"Justice4AllTo answer your question, YES. In fact, IMO, there are 2 western leaders that should have already seen the front end of a firing squad."
Yes - a truly naive piece of scribbling !
What side? Both Sunni & Shia hate the west.
So in your world only leftists follow the law of the land? My Ten Cents cited the Constitution.

"Carbon Dioxide is not a pollutant! It is a vital part of out atmosphere, biosphere and lithosphere. It is plant food. The level of science-illiteracy in this debate is astounding."
"I agree with you regarding the new commenting set up. It makes healthy debate very difficult. As to the article, there is much to agree with, but those who buy it 100% are somewhat lacking inn the critical reasoning skills; lol."
So everything is not hunky-dory in the big European family. Is this the group Scotland is so eager to join and young Londoners are so despondent about leaving?

"Sadly, they do refer to them as 'white schools'. They should be dismissed for such racist comments but are not."
Perhaps because it is neither propaganda or aimed at minors? Perhaps the better question would be why you support random gang violence and beating of people.

"It might be a revelation, although many folks are already aware of it.  I don't think it would necessarily change the Church's thinking because (at least theoretically) all those gay priests, brothers, and sisters are living celibate lives."
I can't believe MPs can actually stomach voting for this. One would think elections would be sacred ground.
why are  all the poeple that get low income houseing .....WHITE...BLACK....LOITYNO.....AND WHY ARE JEWISH POPELE TOLD TO GO TO HELL WHEN THAY TRY TO GET LOW INCOME HOUSEING....??????MABY I SHOULD BUY A

That's not shocking at all. 
Transgender - leave it to states. Weed - Keep it at federal level because states have no rights.
"They are also extremely anti-Catholic, so it is quite amusing to see them defended by our rank and file right wing Catholic wing nuts."
It's not discrimination against transgender people.  The problem is that transgenders cost too much because they want sex change operations which are too  expensive and requires life-long evaluations and follow-ups.
Religious ideology as absurd as it sounds.
...........................How shallow of you. But thanks anyway for your constructive POV.
In other words it's all the arabs fault. Isreal bears no responsibility for the suffering of the palestinians.
Self-hating liberal Jew - a stain on his brethren and his country.
Why not watch a NAZI film on the Jews before making a judgement on Hitler.  Sounds stupid doesn't it.
elevate your debating skills Why and Alceste
"Yes, just like Islamopalooza went down bad last year.  Ctrl-left terrorists shouldn't be tolerated, remember when that Hillary supporter murdered 49 gays in Florida? Mateen and Hodgkinson were just part of a terrorist organization."
"AS long as they do not join to get free surgery fine. If you are trans already and still want to join , do it. But can you do the job?"
Honey?  Did you read the article?  She attacked Pope Francis for saying that countries should be welcoming of immigrants.  That is her whole platform.  That France would be better if she could kick out all the dark skinned people and Muslims.
Gotcha... you are on your way to converting me as well.... God would want it that way...
And the Germans didn't want the Jews so therefore they can just exterminate them   Pregnant women can always give their children up for adoption  Otherwise they suffer the risk if they don't go to confession of possibly going to hell
"Yes, agree. All of these accusations of paranoia are amazing irony. Robert Reich is the fascist. Free speech for all except Christians and conservatives."
"Raskolnikov, Your hatred of Jews has evolved over time in its manifestations and disguises and one can see all three forms in abundance here. Read some history and maybe you'll understand a thing or two about reality. Your antisemitism is disgusting."
That's OK. The United States will protect us again. Of course down the road they will want something in return...
"LOL!   None of this medieval maneuvering has diddly-squat to do with any group of people who call themselves 'Christian,' i.e., followers of Christ.  It may, however, provide Dan Brown with his next stupid book and Tom Hanks with another bad movie."
"Actually, Canadians acting on behalf of the government abroad must abide by the Canadian charter. the Canadian govt cant ignore the charter because they are operating somewhere else"
Think about the nature of the fathers comments.. 'A good son. An educated son.' 'God will punish homosexuals'.. These radicals consider themselves instruments of God. How much longer will we ignore this kind of hateful rhetoric..
"Torontonians were the aggrieved party in this sorry episode. Mr. Ford was in way over his head and became a public embarrassment, on a global scale. Nevertheless, may he rest in peace."
Meanwhile traitorous little potatoes flood their country out with Muslim extremists nobody asked or voted for!
"Since the book of Wisdom is considered apocryphal by Protestants (like President-elect Trump)and Jews, it might not go over so well."
Thats the problem only Islam is being taught in schools. Muslims WILL NOT TOLERATE their children being taught any other religion
"Just some inside info:  the 'you're a  pharisee' smear is from the 'beginner' section of Catholic commenting playbook.  High school, not graduate school."
"What in heaven's name does your obsession with our new PM (maybe it hurts comparing where he is to where you are in life?) have to do with the topic Martin is discussing? Oh, right. Nothing. Off you go, now."
"He?' It appears that your anti-transgender microaggression and degrading bigotry are exposed to the sunlight a bit, there. What I just cannot seem to spy behind all of that is your actual credibility. How hapless."
Yup. We be as quiet as a church mouse and we'll be safe. Yup.
"That's not true of course, but I'm betting that you voted for Trump.  So facts don't matter.  Transgender people have served honorably in combat for years.  You know nothing."
They're just christian conservative perverts. Time to out them for what they are.
Racist Apartheid : Colonies for jews and for jews only. Trump's complaints about illegal immigrants are hilarious by comparison.
"he was a nazi even at 14, and admits he didnt mind what they were doing, , get over it. facts dont change.  KROFT: Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.  Mr. SOROS: Yes. That’s right. Yes. KROFT: No feeling of guilt?  Mr. SOROS: No."
We over praise dads?  That like saying Hitler over praised Jews.
"Disgusting! How, many more decades will it take for the Roman Catholic Church to wise up and do what is morally right? These obstructionists should be stripped of their power and put away in dingy jail cells. I'm ashamed to have ever called myself a Catholic."
Jews were not supposed to have guns in Germany after Hitler took over in the mid-1930s. They had damn few before the advent of that lunatic Schickelgruber.
"As I've said many times before, sodomy is mostly practiced by heterosexuals, so there are, by far, way more heterosexual sodomites out there than there are homosexual ones. And the legal definition of sodomy, by the way, includes oral sex, just so you know."
most candidates of all parties are very poorly qualified.
Why don't you lecture Muslims about how they abuse trucks?
Is this what we want in Canada ? Stand strong Mr Harper. You must protect Canadians first. Trudeau and Mulcair will not protect us https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5L9SExquao
Not 15 years after we pulled the jews from the camp did they begin this genocidal immigration policy along with their cultural marxist policies that also destroy us. they need to go along with their browns
You left out a word: do whatever it takes to stop a gay man's right to HATE speech.
Right on Sarah Sanders!  She's not forcing anything on anybody--it's done silently and privately.  Psalms 14:1 The fool has said there is no God.  Which is in the Jewish Old Testament.   For the loud unbelieving Jewish friends.
"I propose the WNBA all replaced with transgender women. Surely not a problem, no?"
"Attacks on Planned Parenthood, attacks on public schools. Gee, I wonder who could be behind this. Wake up people. There are religions a lot more dangerous to our freedoms than Islam out there."
This is right right out of the roundup of the Jews in Nazi Germany. Rise up. Rise up. Rise up against this FAKE president.
what a hypocritical statement by one who hates jews and other Asians.  if racism hurts America than you are one of those hurting America.
"I haven't heard of any 'homosexuals' disturbing your religious holidays or celebrations, so why don't you and your 6-8 other people leave them alone during theirs?"
"Don't worry about GOP, the Democrats are not doing any better. They are becoming the party for queers and 'minorities'."
Don't want to leave anyone out.    Sandy Hook Elementary School - children murdered by a heavily armed JEWISH white guy.  There fixed it for ya.
"The Jews in Germany would have loved to be treated as the Palis are treated. No ovens, no concentration camps, no genocide. No one is going to question support for Israel other than commie-pinkos, the chronic Jew haters, and assorted riff raff."
Not in the Conservatives family. You are not part of them.
"Rubbish.  You ARE lying, and your 'faith' is certainly not Catholic"
What about state right Donny Boy? That is what you said about transgender rights? This man is such a liar!!
Get lost with your stupid slave stuff. The Jews were slaves and they seem to be doing OK.
How does sharing a bathroom with a transgender person negatively affect your life?
"When you start talking about muslim fascists, maybe ten we can talk about your concerns."
Comparing the treatment of pigs to the treatment of Jews?  You might want to rethink your unhinged comment
You have just raised the issue of religious misogyny (and not to mention hate and death among gays) that the MSM will not discuss nor are Canadians allowed to bring up in a multicultural society.
Churchill never mentioned even once the Holocaust of the Jews in his books on WW2 published after the war. Neithet did US generals Eisehhower & others. Why?  Were they all anti-semite?
" white jew-god mind', well we know where 3d's head is at.  Bigotry and racism.  Must be another graduate of the Hawaiian Studies program at the U of H."
"This seems a bit far fetched even if the Anti-Defamation League asked Trump to reconsider. Trump is not saying, 'America First...except for you Jews.' Maybe the ADL is being a bit overly sensitive...but then, that's what they do."
and someone wearing a cross around their neck also blocks your view of their face?
Personally I think transgender people should have the right to evidence-based medical treatment rather than being led to invasive procedures and heavy drug regimens prescribed by gender-identity politics.
"You mean the 'Christian' who has repeatedly threatened to immolate 70 million men, women and children by deploying tactical nuclear weapons against the Islamic Republic of Iran? If Killary is a 'Christian', then so is satan."
Nothing but thinly disguised Christian Supremacy.
"Why he is just a white, good ol' boy carrying his legal supply of weapons, disciplining his family members when they fail to obey the patriarch as religious dogma dictates.  No crime here, just performing his duties as white, christian rules apply."
if you are a Muslim you cannot be a Canadian as your values are incompatible with western society.

"Trump is right.  Let's hope this move prevents the USAs form becoming like France, where Salafist mosques are popping like mushrooms and hate against western values taught to millions of muslim kids."
"The problem is much worse than simple indoctrination.  We now have parents who are working with the medical establishment to prevent puberty to 'help' transgender children.  So people who cannot vote, drink alcohol, or drive are being purposely mutilated.  This is child abuse."
"@IvyW: and, besides being so full of yourself, how do you contribute to Canada that you think you should have a say in choosing its government?"
"Hilarious how the evangelicals tied their hopes to an atheist pedophile vile human like Trump. Sorry Mike Pence, no one buys the fake ass holy than now shit"
"The Muslim apologists, and the Globe has three of them as editorial writers, are in overdrive to distract from where the real threats lie."
Thankful for Canada's support of Ukraine and recognition of struggle Ukrainians have undergone for many years.
"Because transgender people have been a tiny, tiny, miniscule number of people and their political agenda is not directly harmful to men, only to women, so MSM don't really care about it."
"Unloving, yes. You would have us believe that God is as homophobic as you are. And, given that you reject Dignitatis Humanae, you are NOT faithful to Church teaching."
Love the tin hat crowd
Surely you haven't forgotten Pierre Poilievre. They've done a goodd job of keeping him in hiding.
It's mainly muslim hate for each other and everyone else
RobHave faith. Give people a chance to live like you do.
"Wikipedia is written by people who have a wide diversity of opinions, but we try hard to make sure articles have a neutral point of view.

SCOTUS just folded on the transgender bathroom issue.
"God bless you, and may He return the kindness that you have given."
He just said it because of the pressure that is being put on his administration to denounce the the violence and hatred that is being directed to Jews.
"The article didn't talk about Viagra or the cigarettes they used to pass out, only the transgender."
Surely your not suggesting this man was invincibly ignorant of Catholic teaching or was compelled to behave in the way he did?
"diverdave, why walk when you can fly first class, over that wall. any terrorists worth their vest will get anywhere they want to, anytime they want to. this is an anti muslim, fire up the base act."
"Let's do a fun exercise here. Substitute 'transgender student' for 'Trump supporter student' as the topic in your critique. Should they be ashamed now? I don't believe so. We do not become inclusive by treading on the rights of others, especially in our publicly funded institutions."
Maybe the Aboriginal people could move to the Middle East? Your post is really really stupid. Do you think the Arabs care about Aboriginals? Of course not. It's just a convenient way of getting at Canada.
"Larry,  Always bet on the Jewish Superguy."
"There is no equivalency between the two. One group is evil and wants to do away with blacks, jews, etc... and the other, the antifa, wants to do away with the evil racists that think that way. Not the same thing....."
"Anderson Stevenson: Even if you believe that sending priests 1500 years later is good enough, it's hardly a sign of omnipotence. After Jesus was resurrected why didn't he spread the message to the rest of the world?"
From Russia with love...to Transgender in bathroom! Good move DJT.
"Funny that you haven't mentioned the Viagra or the cigarettes they used to pass out, only the transgender."
one way to curtail fighting? Have law / act state it cannot be shown or commented on through the media - any media. If there was a fight and dead air or some replay the league intelligentsia would soon get the message.
When I was growing up transgendered people were known as in local vernacular chicks with d##ks.
I would be more impressed if Trudeau would speak out against the Montreal iman who preaches death to jews in his mosque.
"SMM: Electorate has spoken? When? You mean the 39.5% popular vote for the Liberals? Craft a good law? How naive. For your sake, I hope you never find yourself in a situation where your life will be snuffed out against your wishes."
"Ah, poor straight, white Christians. So persecuted."
Nope...not true. Beck retired before Osama was taken out.    And did not 'trans' until after leaving the military.
Jews only intermarry when there is big money on the table hence Kushner taking Trumps daughter.
"Dear Mr. Hound38 Do I understand that, aside from the items you mentioned, you are a sound supporter of Mr. Harper?"
"From a 'fair work place' in a very short time, became, 'marriage, adoption, 'hate crimes' special privilege, and has gone on to 'transgender toilets' that we ALL must use, or be called 'haters'.  Call away then."
I have to wonder if your comments have more to do with Trump than any concern over transgender men or women.  You don't know that   'transgendered' is an inappropriate term that should be not be used.
"And good on you for doing it, too - your commitment has not flagged, and now is when we need it most."
"no sweetheart, they're going to slowly buy up everything you own, settle your lands and put you to work in factories and you'll be cheering them on"
"Islam makes for wonderfully tolerant, enriching and inclusive societies. It's not only a religion of peace but of joy as well."
"that is a silly statement. the Jewish people had rules set out by God, and I am a gentile."
The Trudeau cabinet members and staff appear to have no sense of ethical responsibility. Brison's response is cavalier and shows he is completely unaware that this is a serious allegation of impropriety. Having a gay husband doesn't give him a free pass.
I am not anti-gay. i am for gay rights as long as they are not superior to rights of others. Neither of these two facts are evidence of support for the assertion of choice.
Maybe we should ask his Orthodox Jewish son-in-law and his daughter who converted to the faith  why he is such an anti-Semite.
The case of Sauve v. Canada was about the right of a person who is incarcerated in the prison system and does not address residency. In fact the decision refers to ' certain permanent residents' also 'citizens and residents'

"Or maybe considering how it's ISLAM which specifically officially and quite repetitively commands the global genocide of all the non-muslim cultures, religions, and peoples of the world, it's only a legal, moral, and defensive stance? Unless you think 'muslims' are a 'race?'  ;-)"
The future of the Catholic Church in this country is becoming more and more Hispanic.  That is one of the reasons so many white Catholics jumped on Trump's racist bandwagon.
Tabby Cat is using it in a disgusting offensive way and damn right it's a slur. It's a slur against every single non-transsexual person out there.    Wake up. The 'victims' of bigotry are now the bullies.   Tabby Cat isn't funny and should be dismissed for her hateful rant.
"MEN OF CALGARY: GO GAY! It is the only thing that will save your skin. But in today's heated feminist empire, being gay may not be a defence from an accusation of sexual impropriety."
Martin is a homosexual and wants to be able to let everyone know.  Like all the homosexuals feel compelled to do for some reason.
Christianity at least is based on 'turn the other cheek'.
"These are matters of facts, not belief.  You can certainly try to brainwash gay people into thinking they are straight, but it has not been shown to work very well."
I am NOT protecting or condoning the alleged behavior!  I'm pointing out the 'he did this because he is gay' bigotry.
Which 'Church' are you referring  to...the Roman Catholic Church  or the True Christian Church?
"Well, if she's only gay at church..."
"[To those with the right shoe size:]  Surgery? A lie. Outgrow TG 'feelings'? Non-trans do. Trans children never, and when imprisoned in a strange body, the results are often tragic and lethal.

"Here we go again - the rant about the Crusades, which were the Catholics, when people use this argument they simply showcase their ignorance."

"Not all Republicans are racists. However, they are all collaborators with racists. They are like the 'good Germans' that never asked, where did the Jews disappear to? Today, they never question why cops kill so many unarmed black  people, including children."
"The hypocrisy of leaning on Christianity as a crutch that dignifies and attempts legitimacy is front and center, in the past, present, and future. So much to look forward too."
But EWTN types told me that women have the important role in the Catholic Church doing all the menial grunt work that men don't want to under the 'leadership' of the more intelligent malefolk.  Sarc off/

I wonder how many people remember that Quebec was once the most difficult province to live in if you were Jewish.
Drake is half black. Being a Jew is not a race its a set of ideas like other religions. Ivanka Trump is Jewish because she converted nothing to do with this talk about race and other nonsense.

LOL.  Please tell me it includes the one that thinks that having boys do household chores turns them gay.
"Trump speaks to solid Americans.  The ones who work hard for modest wage.  The democrats speak to special interests such as the gays, illegal immigrants, and rich narcissists who view themselves as better than their fellow Americans."
"If Francis is concerned about the health of Vatican staff....what about the health hazards associated with gay sex (including depression, AIDS, suicide) and cocaine use among Vatican staff?"
Literally the dumbest shit I've read in decades.
What a disgusting person.  How many offensive things has he said about other people and never apologized for.    What she tweeted happens to be true.   After all there were GOOD people chanting 'Jews will not replace us' at the white supremacist rally.
It's like giving a dying patient a transfusion with blood from his other arm.

Jews are whites too and whites are not the most advanced race either.
"Not surprising Nikki, considering that millions serve and only a very tiny fraction are 'trans.'  It is using statistics to make a false point."
He wanted to hold an anti-lgbt rally right before the Pride festival? Disgusting. There’s no room for that kind of hatred here on the Harbor. It’s easy to believe the rest of the story when the owner’s actions at city hall show what’s in his heart.
"Oh deer: Hitler really! I have nothing but respect for Jews, they are truly a remarkable people. It's you retread, left wing , tambourine banging, pot circle sloths I have no time for. Ps love your conspiracy theories, do you hear voices?"
"The modernity comment was solely regarding the sentence on transgender folks.  And that is a modern phenomenon. Not in terms of the existence of such folks, but of the familiarity of enough laypersons to raise the subject to the level of commonplace everyday conversation."
"Well for starters, you're an excellent example of an off-putting individual, gay or otherwise.  Prefacing your rhetorical question w/an accusation isn't going to generate good will any time soon now is it?"
Gary:  Are you a Homosexual??????
Nope.  Trump's campaign promise was a Muslim ban.
How do you progs become such extremists?
Glad he dealt with this because the issue of transgender soldiers in the military was keeping me up at night as one of the greatest problems currently facing the nation. (sarcasm)
"colon7, you are partially right. Religion is the problem. A minority of one religion."
It was not immigrants that caused the carnage at that mosque.  It was not multiculturalism. It was not Islam. It was sheer unadulterated hatred. Pure bigotry. Revolting xenophobia.   Your attempt to justify the slaughter in Quebec is beyond repulse.
Part of living under Russian rule is that gays don't have rights. Perhaps you liberals would be happier living outside the USSR?
"Because, in this instance at least, the Vatican is making a big deal over nothing."
"Of course you did, Duke. You often do do. Your dour attitude and denigration of something as basic as human joy puts you far closer to the Islamists than to the rest of us. You deserve pity."

And I bet that in the day you expected your Jewish classmates to smile when you walked into that exclusive country club.  And you expected your black classmates to do the honourable thing and avoid using the whites only washrooms and lunch counters.
"No, the Saudis are the largest funder of Daesh, which is a natural expression of Wahhabism. How many Christians, Jews or Atheists live in Mecca?"
I wouldn't say that 'Being gay has nothing to do with being a pedarast.' Pederasty is a 'sub-set' of male homosexuality. So a pederast is a homosexual male while not all homosexual males are pederasts. So 'nothing to do with' is overstating it.
"So you think it's un-Christian for a nation to have borders?  Absurd.  And since when are you a Christian fundamentalist?  Unless it's in the Bible, it's wrong?  Absurd.  Love requires we take in all the poor who manage to cross our borders?  Absurd."
"I thought a fresh batch of trolls.  Probably from 'Church Militant.' Same crowd historically that favored slavery, lynched, segregated, slaughtered natives. 'Onward Christian Soldiers,' again; battle ready."

The irony is that those who support Ford's right-wing populism are exactly those who most benefit from social programs and the taxes that pay for them. This has been the 'success' of Canada's right wing: making taxation a dirty word.
Your concern would be touching if it weren't a canned talking point.  Nobody needs to be trans or a soldier to be in danger in these third world dumpster fires. If you walk upright you qualify.  The best solution ? Stay out of these 'heck' holes.
"I take issue with 'the god of the Jewish Bible is a cruel, vindictive, angry assassin'.  In addition it appears to be unrelated to the article."

Just in -  Trump has transgendered from female rattle snake to spitting cobra!
The problem secularists seem to have with Christians is they mistake the Christian disciplines we impose on ourselves as being judgemental on their secular ways. People who are truly comfortable in their own ways don't have this issue.
"You make no sense whatsoever. You're saying that it's perfectly rational to subjugate and dehumanize women, homosexuals, and Atheists?"
"He lamented that more children in the United States are raised in families led by unmarried mothers.'  We lament that, too, but don't put that one gay people.  Gay couples, in most cases, are helping children who were abandoned, as if they were strays."
"Rest easy, Harper will win the next election and just like Benjamin Yahoo he will repeal this legislation and blame his Finance Minister for this stupidity."
Something gay went wrong
Don't remember you. Obviously no one cared what you said. 
We treat the 2nd Amendment like a death lottery and we are all potential blood sacrifices. How many of those concert goers thought they had bought lottery tickets? I thought Jesus made human sacrifices unnecessary. I'm sure a lot of those concert goers thought they were Christians.
"You like to use the word Facist, seth. Do please tell us what you understand that label to mean. Then compare and contrast your 'notion' with reality."
"While essentially agreeing with all the above, I'd suggest we not forget the striking history of anti-Jewish pogroms over the hundred years prior to the Bolshevik revolution."
"Allowing perverted young males posing as transgenders to have access to female bathrooms will also have 'consequences'.  Rapes or suicides, what's your choice?"
"Oh, come on, Thatcher - you didn't even mention the current Jones/Infowars conspiracy theory that Jewish actors were impersonating the white supremacists, KKK and Nazis to discredit them. You're slipping."
There are very few people who are really transgendered with chromosomal abnormalities. Others who feel between genders would benefit from therapy..less drastic than genital mutilation followed by a lifetime taking hormone therapy
"When a Christian performs a terrorist act, do you label it a Christian act of terrorism?  People of all religions engage in terrorist acts, most North American terrorist acts are perpetrated by Christians, because they're the majority of terrorists in North America."
Peter MacKay: He?s the Minister of Wrong Again... Why is it that everything the harper CONservatives do is WRONG ????
While we're sharing personal facts that have nothing to do with the column: My dog has a fluffy tail.
Trump's tweets expertly tilt the scales of justice against his Muslim ban
How is baking a cake for a gay couple exceeding his obligations?
The fact that transgender people need medical treatment for their condition tells it all.  Normal people come either male or female and require no medical treatment to stay that way.
uniquely Canadian' really means 'from Cana-duh'
Another way the Catholic Church can distract from the fact that they condone child rape.
If a military draft is necessary during war time is Trump prepared to give Trans-gendered people an exemption? Or do exemptions only apply to rich kids with heel spurs?
Science applied with your sense of the 'sacredness of the planet' and just a smidgin' of concern for one's offspring ?
Islam teaches hate. Muslims need to be run out of this country. They are a disgusting death cult
Lots of people are happy to live under a dictator as long as they feel safe.
globe editors.. stooping to new lows every day... Run along little editors... Harper beckons with more lies..
What is ridiculous is suggesting an equivalency between the number of attacks on jews in Canada and the number of attacks  on Irish people in Canada.
Of course Trump blames the black guy.  Hurricane Maria was the fault of Puerto Ricans.  The Jews caused Nazis.   Blacks force themselves to be abused by the cops.
A priest raping a child is hysterical.  Your comment history shows your reverence for the church and seems to be missing the teachings of Christ.
"One of the hallmarks of a complex mind or a complex civilization is the ability to recognize, focus on, and address REAL problems. Which bathroom transgender people use, isn't one of them."

Simple answer: people who don't like muslims care.
"Freedom of expression should not include allowing women to be repressed or supporting Islamic extremists. i wish I could reference an article in the G&M, written by two Muslim women as to why we should not support the wearing of the niqab."

Did you watch the videos? Only one side was chanting about killing Jewish people and listening to a KKK leader speak.
They have the same rights to life and security of the person as you do.

Rodney Howard-Browne is a heretic and an embarrassment to Christianity.
Lattes and Danish. The USA will protect us.
The Holy Bible is wholly babble. It's a bookfull of lies and ancient superstitions. The good news is the trend is overwhelmingly against religion and towards commonsense and science.
Trudeau is like all other politicians on the left. They have abandoned the LGBTQ community in favour of another community that persecutes and murders gays. Trudeau certainly wouldn't wish to offend his new best friends - the ones with the quaint cultural practices that offend most civilized people.
I am happy the community allows dissenting voices. I wouldn't subscribe here if all dissenting voices were banned like in other pathetic groups I've been in. 
"If this insanity continues, one cannot help but wonder if Ivanka will eventually be forced to choose between her racist daddy (and his low-info racist supporters), and her Jewish husband.    Boy, do I miss having the adults in charge of things. Not surprising most Americans miss Obama."

Moore’s candidacy points to what everyone should abhor:  Extremist Christian nationalism.  Elimination of the separation of Church and State is their primary goal.  (…and they get to define the official religion as whatever suits their agenda as they go along.)  Roy Moore is simply another psychotic whack right wing candidate.
Be careful what you wish for Jimmy.  Minorities are generally not treated well by republicans.  Who knows what will happen to you.  You might even be sent to Gitmo because they think you are Muslim.

Don't forget Infidel. It's not just the Jews they want to kill.
The fact that 52% of US Catholics voted for Donald Trump would indicate that a lot of microphones in Catholic Churches aren't working at all. 😉
How many vegans are transgendered?
"Being gay has nothing to do with being a pedarast, not to mention being a sexual predator.   So gross all around."
Arabs and Jews are both semites so maybe learn the right terminology if you are going to use it. You probably mean anti-Zionist but calling for equal rights is neither so you are just flat out wrong.....
Now that is laughable......If you heard nothing it is because you weren't trying to hear. I can't believe you would even imply something like this. Are you trying to imply this guy is a Christian ? A mass murderer ?
"Amazing numbers. In 14 years, the Huston area paved over 54,000 acres of wetlands. Such hubris. Moreover, Texas is officially a climate change denial state. The whole disaster has been caused by gay marriage."
Not at the cost of the Human diginity of all women called to priesthood.  Justice First or we are not really Christian.  We are merely haters of women.
Garbage. The earth is entering thirty year cooling phase. The war on coal and oil will stop as soon as a Republican is in the White House. President Obama has been mislead by his science adviser.

"Where was all the concern for persecuted Christians in the Middle East. Oh I forgot, Justin doesn't own a pair of socks with a cross on them."
It seems ironic that Trump worries them but the influx of Arab muslims and their murderous ways is oh so noble.
Obama allowed them to start serving in the final few months of his 8 year presidency. For some reason Transgendered soldiers became a priority for him after 7 years and 9 months.   Such fake outrage on the left.
Thanks for voting Liberal. Nice to see things working out so well....
"Oh, Lord! Please stop citing Christianity to the exclusion of all other spiritual systems. There is so much in common with so mnay religions that it strikes me as exceptionally narrow-minded to attribute virtue exclusively to any one of them."

"Vote4Me: Sure, sure. No need to get too excited."
Rejecting homosexuality on religious and making a business transaction are not related.

That my comment has gotten under your skin with such little effort on my part gives me more pleasure that I can relay to you. Thank you. The bonus is that the quality of your comment proves Mill's point.
Another reason that I should be allowed to declare my cat as my dependent and/or spouse. Harper already was loosing me after he stopped home mail delivery... this just finalizes things. I will hold my nose and vote for Justin.

"God bless, hope he makes you dreams come true."
And to think she was a woman does not guarantee Muslim terrorists women won't shoot  us or your kids. Remember terrorists. Not because they are muslim.
"The Church does not teach that Mary 'never died'. Projecting your sexual issues, much?"
Standing up to those who would eliminate you and your country is honorable. The only bullies in this conflict are the hateful Jew-hating Palestinians and their terrorist civilian-stabbing inhabitants whose goal is to eradicate Jews.
"Grekoff, yes. The scientific evidence is that, for the past three or four years, the corporate media elites have been braying constantly in favour of transgender 'rights'."
More than a 'wink'  one  neonazi site said he had a Jewish gun to his head to make the speech.
"And thanks to Alberta and Quebec before her, Canadians everywhere know it can be done. Let's go, Canada!"
Really?  Does everyone really want to round up the Jews again?  I don't and I stand against racist pieces of garbage like her.  She even helped radicalize the right wing terrorist in Quebec who slaughtered six law abiding Canadians.
"So tell me again about how loving, peaceful and tolerant Islamists are."
“alternative facts” that are spread about Muslims by anti-Muslim bigots.  --- There you have it: everyone criticizing Islam or Muslim societies practices are bigots and their speech is 'alternative facts' or soon hate.
This should be pretty simple for you to understand...

@Sher .. >> I know that a lot of people have .... Can you tell me what the weaknesses in western culture are? .. Why is it that people flock to live in Western countries - including immigrants from Muslim countries.  How many non-Muslims choose to immigrate to Muslim countries?
Very true John but obviously God-fearing Americans are more afraid of the possible threat from foreigners believing in a different deity than they are of sure death at the hands of an Second Amendment-quoting American born-again Christian. Better the devil you know perhaps.
Your post violates the first principle: Human intelligence in good faith. Jesus' maleness demonstrates only that 'He' was/is male.
KATO 50- 'still do wield enormous power in (Iran) to the point that they can dictate who runs the government.' You are talking about Mr. Harper aren't you ?? CAREFUL.
Could you explain how Obama was blatantly anti-Israel?  Lots of Jews inside and outside of Israel strongly disagree with the expansion of settlements but that does not make them anti-Israel. One can still support Israel and criticize their policies that appear to undermine a long term peace agreement.

"Jews will not replace us, Jews will not replace us.'  You down with that?"
Human life begins when one makes the choice to bear that life into existence.
Liberal party has already been charged with illegal robocalls. Try to pay attention.
You know its not racism if it is the truth.
Actually there have been success's. Kobani and Sinjar to be specific. Sinjar and the close by mountain have split the ISIS held territory in half. ISIS will now have to retake Sinjar or re establish communications through the Desert.
How refreshingly void of content.
"Interesting - I think those were the exact same excuses generals used in the past to keep blacks, women, and gays out of the military as well."
It was Catholics vs Protestants. How peripheral is that?
I did. And it's filled with the usual veiled anti-Islam rhetoric you've posted in the past.  If that's not the case then you need to explain yourself better.
"Harper and Kenney are ideologues.  Kenney's campaign style is divisive and hateful. His party has attacked women, gays and minorities. But keep attacking the messenger."
"Yrs, Ben Shapiro is a white supremacist.  You people do know he and his family are Orthodox Jews.  Ignorant people!"
"Can we please get away from gender,  transgender, race and other issues and  simply evaluate performances on merit alone?"
"No, gay or not, you should hate yourself if you are in a state of sin."
"The international community must respond to attacks on gay men in Chechnya'  Such attacks are deplorable, but if we acted every time a columnist told us we 'must' something, there'd be no time to enjoy an occasional doob."
Trump is more like the anti-Christ. He literally checks off all the boxes that the Bible warned us about.
Who am I to judge?' means very little when you just got fired for being gay while working for a church.
"Fuck, what a brutal story. "
"All the examples you give, are civil servants. Thanks for proving our point"
Who cares. Hamas and Hezbollah and the Palestinian Authority have continuously threatened Israel and its Jewish population with destruction and elimination and eradication.
Jews only marry outside of their religion when there is money on the table. If she wasn't an heir to Trumps billions Kushner wouldn't have even kicked her tires.
"Yes, it leads to a Breitbart webpage. Pffft."

"No, it was right-wing evangelical hypocrite blowhard Jimmy Swaggart that was related to Jerry Lee Lewis."
"In response to this, two progressive Catholics put a laughing face emoji below your post.  Both were totally unable to offer a cogent rebuttal, and masked their ineptitude with ridicule."
"Given that Trump has shown himself to be a narcissistic, lying, sexist, racist bigot, he DESERVES to be attacked. Certainly, no Christian should support him. Do you really believe he gives a damn about abortion?"
"Terrorists didn't round up the Jews in Germany and systematically kill them: the state did. His message was crap, too."
So an unelected and unaccountable judge used his power whatever way he chose to exonerate an unelected and unaccountable senator. What a surprise!
"There are scholarly/credible/etc. sources who say the gay priests, seminarians, bishops, et al. do NOT live celibate lives.  Why does it matter?"
I can't believe the Denver Post published this witless slur against transgender people.
WE' have been trying to 'make things work' for 147 years. All Quebec has to do is to join us with a sincere effort to do the same. Throwing Queen Marois out is a very good step in that direction.
" A lesbian ,  a native,  and a Rabi are in a life boat ... '  Yadda yadda yadda"
Kenney supports the corrupted catholics and therefore is incapable to unite Albertans.  Religions are used by politicians to divide societies.
Why should Trump receive a 'pat on the back' for enforcing equal protection for the LGBT community?  Trump's too far from the eight ball to receive any pat on the back.  A swift kick in the butt perhaps.
"Protesting against Islamophobia?!?   Sigh...Alice, close your eyes, we've reached a new level of sheer stupidity.  I wish these same progressives would protest against antisemitism.

Does that make her an 'enemy?' Seems to me that she pays taxes like everyone else does. She is entitled to her opinion too. Or do Conservatives have a problem with free speech?

"So how do you classify Kevin Spacey?  He says he's homosexual not a pedophile.  The research you're talking about comes from the psychology arena that I spoke about earlier.  It's all biased, weak research."

Steve Hewitt wrote that Islamophobia is a cause of Islamist terrorism.  What a perfect example of putting the cart before the horse.  It's far more likely that Islamist terrorism is the cause of Islamophobia.
So Hitler wasn't anti Jewish because he didn't kill all the jews?
"You clearly have a rose-colored view.  Do you know what it is like to be an English speaking native of Quebec living in or visiting Quebec? ... Less fun than you'd think.  It gets even better if your mother, also a Quebec native, is Jewish."

"Liberals being against ecumenism, who'd ever expect to see that. And 'traditional ecumenism' - what's that, 'Return to the Catholic Church'? How hypocritical: ecumenism is only ok with Christians more liberal than us. From Fr. '2+2 sometimes = 5'."
"Trump calls for unity? I guess that means that all Americans should just accept the white supremacist Nazis, shouting 'Jews won't replace us', 'blood and soil'?  Capitulation to these lowlifes hopefully will never happen."
"“[Progressive activists] were calling me a Nazi, a fascist, and an anti-Semite,” Dr. Gad Saad, a Concordia University marketing professor and one of the panelists, told TheDCNF. “I’m Jewish.

"It's not a ban of all Muslims in the Universe. I know, hard to believe, but it is a ban on Muslims from certain countries. Are you simple?"
"The US has received zero terrorists from any of the banned countries, ever.  Not a single one.  Trump is playing the terrorist excuse to ban legitimate refugees, because he hates muslims.  period."
"How long until somebody accuses her of murdering Servaas, her lesbian lover? I say 12 minutes."
Because at most they make up 0.3% of the population? Clearly the left is in the next phase of making traditional Western culture disappear with their propaganda and social engineering. Next phase of the destruction of the west after 'Trans' is normalized will be pedophilia mark my words.

Gutless self serving politicians are afraid of losing the Christian vote so they will not do the humane thing to stop people from dying a painful death. Get rid of the useless career politicians.
"You know who else was obsessed with perfect genes, right?   Hitler, who had Josef Mengele at his side experimenting on humans to find the perfect one, while killing millions of Jews.   The obsession with genes on the part of this president and his administration is really disgusting."
I was watching on HBO with candles and shouting your friends marching last weekend. They chanted the following: - 'the Jews will not replace us' - 'whose streets? our streets!' - 'Blood and Soil' an old Nazi chant This is outrageous and hateful. It was done by your side. Wake up!
I wonder what Putin's or Jung Un's policies are regarding transgender soldiers?  Do  they have their military forces  cover the costs of the operation and hormones ?
There's some justification for excluding the women carrying the Israeli flag. They should know that Israel is a devisive topic whereas being Jewish isn't.
How about a man who has transgendered into a woman.  Does he-she then become a qualified woman owned business?
"You think your ""expertise"" is worth something? You uneducated rube! In the real world, what YOU think is exactly meaningless."
"You obviously don't know what you are talking about. If you are a 'catholic', you don't know much about your religion. Nobody is playing dress up. And if you aren't Catholic, you should keep your mouth shut and hide your ignorance."
"The president is commander in chief of every branch of the U.S. military.'  Since President Trump is also grabber-in-chief, is he going to issue a ruling on whether or not transgender people can grab?"
"Ever since they got their segregated Dyke March, Pride has been fractured and fragmented bit by bit, year after year until now, gay men are not really part of the festivities other than as spectators who are expected to shut up and buy something."
"If you are annoyed by it, you don't really understand it."
"My, what a cleverly SUBTLE example of Muslim-bashing!  I don't think I've been subjected to such a devastatingly articulate rejoinder since...possibly the 7th grade.  I-I-I think I might just cry..."
Well put sir. Or Ma'am. And... these are probably birds from the same flock who still think of 'Jews' as a race.
Effeminate men are as likely to be asexual as homosexual.  Priests are as likely one or the other.
"Where? Did I miss it? Damn. Besides, are you aware that Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, and one of the most important and effective people on his transition team is Jewish?"

"US/Saudi supported 'moderate' terrorist head-choppers' No, Islamic supported and trained... Countries don't train people to be head choppers, organ eaters and yell 'Allah Akbar while killing each other and innocent people."
"Sorry Alexandea, any group that denies science and wants to trample over the constitution's freedom of religion- for all religions- is wrong. There are many beliefs in evangelicals 'faith' as well as Catholics 'faith' that are plain stupid!"
It also executed gays.  Are you for that too.
I agree with those many trans-gendered.
"The fact that gays find sex between man and woman revolting is testament to their intrinsic disorder. Tell the truth, for once, Bindner.  Tell the truth."
"I think you should have used the term, empathy, instead of, compassion."
"GE, I agree ! Why they we elect this lying liberal government 3 times in a row ?"
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say the vast majority of Americans are not in favor of transgenders serving. Obumbler's policy change was stupid.
And Charlie Hebdo's editors routinely pulled cartoons that mocked Jews and Israel. Hypocrisy!
"Meanwhile, in RC American schools gay students had better remain in the closet, or else!"
Transgender soldiers follow the same rules as other soldiers and face the same consequences as other soldiers for disrupting good order and discipline.  What is your point?  That soldiers who dislike and don't trust transgenders might act out and disrupt good order and discipline?
"To cut roots of terrorism, enforce the Rule of Law"
2 million? I'm going to vomit. Muslims have not built this country or any western country.  But they all seem to want to move to the west and then change it. Multiculturalism is proving to be a terrible idea.
"Sara, here is a small sample from A.L., paragraph 259 'There are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God’s plan for marriage and family.” Emphasis on the 'and family' part."
Don't be over confident. Muslins that Trump tried to stop from entering the U.S. freely enter Hawaii. It's just a matter of time before we experience terrorists activities. No longer a question of 'if' but 'when' and 'where'.
"I agree. But access to psychological help is almost non existent for most Canadians, unless they can pay for it privately, or have a good health plan at work."
"A wonderfully expressive article that accurately encapsulates my feelings towards yesterdays events. Keep up the good work Ms. Wente, you just gained a new supporter."
"If their an obese transgender, do they get in?"

I like the study showing lower IQs correlate highly with right wing tendenciesneed some certainty in your life? like authority? is thinking for yourself too much trouble? vote conservative
Note to Liberals: Bringing up the existence of Trump to in an attempt to shut up dissent about your insane immigration policies and your frantic rush to bring in Muslim refugees is pretty pathetic and insulting to anyone of intelligence.
It's because the editors don't know anything.
The Nazi went after German Jews and Aryan Germans later.' . The Nazis went after 'Aryan Germans' ?   Really ?  How amazing !!!
Muslims cannot emigrate to Japan
"You are right, homeopathy has much in common with faith healing. Utter quackery."
M-103 is the discrimination. It's unnecessary identity politics. It's religious fools trying to get a foot in the door. It's complete nonsense supported by flakes and it should go in the trash bin where all religious con jobs should go.  Is that Islamophobia?
"Why is Islam allowed in our schools?  It is much more than a religion, it is a comprehensive system - political, military, religious and dietary.  You cannot have Islam without sharia."
"Trump also won because people despised the cabal that barnacled itself to Hillary: banksters, media owners, globalizers and the Republican elites they own, Democratic insiders, satchel-faced Radcliffe and Bryn Mawr psychopaths, Big Labour bosses ..."

"Let's see.. a group that supports children with very little funds is a bad thing. Attorneys helping the organization and victims, is a bad thing.  Yet the catholic church with enormous amounts of donations and funds can manipulate law makers to deny the abused, is OK"
"In the warped mind of the killer's father: Kallie is a good Christian girl from a good Christian family and the media (FAKE NEWS!) blew the story way out of proportion, so she should be let off. She's probably the real victim here.  GFY, Mr. Kuhasz."
"This isn't about women in combat, its about transexuals in combat. The women in combat ship sailed long ago.  But hey, keep screaming on the dock if it makes you happy."
"An interesting question, but one you're not going to try to answer, I see, slofstra.  I'll give my opinion on yours, though.  The fact that TWU would be the only law school with this rule makes it no better than a single corner store which refuses to serve jews."
"The birth control mandate, if originally inserted in Obamacare, would have just as easily passed. Why? Because it is essential that Western Judaea Christian America continue to contracept itself into oblivion for a successful 'fundamental transformation' by the Godless left to occur."
Or a lawyer!
"It is reportedly said that one of the Justices, Lebel, even talked about freedom from religion. If this is true here you have a justice totally misrepresenting the text of the Constitution openly. Really incredible."
"It's about fuckin' time that a World Leader takes a stand against Evil Islam/Muslims.  Hopefully our White Trash Racemixing Liberal Govt. will follow suit, but I won't hold my breath."
It's called faith or believe for a reason. Logic is an attempt to either confirm or debunk ones faith or believe. To believe does not require logic.
I think the issue is more about being forced to stare at Mr. Winky at a female spa (no offence to transgender people).
"When Trump moves the US embassy to  Jerusalem, the Palestinians will have to be very careful not to damage American  property when they blow up Jews."
Donald Trump is on the record for bragging about being a sexual predator.  U.S. Catholic Bishops have a long well-documented history of protecting sexual predators that otherwise conform with their positions.  No surprise that the bishops would overlook Trumps major character flaw.
"You not only do not understand fascism, you do not grasp the conditions for fascism to flourish. And by trying to peg me as Jason, you have revealed yourself to be no more than a troll trying to annoy readers and commenters alike."
"Trying to tie Christianity to white supremacy seems a real stretch.'  I'm told stretching keeps us limber. Just because I can't reach my toes, doesn't mean they aren't there."
Because then both boys and girls can get shot at equally !
"Good find but it leaves one question unanswered.  Was that person transgendered, of was it simply a disguise to  commit a crime?"
The Middle East conflict is not about freedom but personal security. These countries have never been free in the sense of democratic.
Who knew that anti Muslim vitriol would embolden violent racists to perpetrate viscous attacks. It just doesn't make sense.
"Accepting and promoting are different things, whether you talk about legal homosexuality and a right to marriage or legal abortion."
"Passer. You speak as though the Supreme Court was the highest power in the land. Who cares what they ""require""?"
None of the programs that Pope Francis is talking about discuss transpeople at length.  The French program that Pope Francis condemned is about gender equality.  The real issues is that Pope Francis wants women to be broodmares for Jesus.
Residential schools were Implemented and supported by the Government of Canada and  allowed the Catholics to do what they wanted.  Now Trudeau want's an apology from the Pope?  How about Canada  taking responsibility instead of pointing figures at others.
"And in other news, anti-Jewish bigotry and incitement to violence given a green light.  Now get out there and a punch a Jew!  Oh sorry, punch a Zionist!!"
"Trump's surprise ban on transgendered people in the military is ridiculous. They were allowed before, identifying them is hard, they're not *nearly* as expensive as conservatives claim, and there's no clear instruction on what to do with the transgendered individuals already serving."
Muslims are the ones who wanted this passed dude.  Show some sympathy for the victims.  Amazing heartlessness in some of these posts
"Whether you are guy, bi, trans, straight, nobody cares.  Using your orientation, as if it makes any difference, or because of that, your opinion counts more--it does not."
I doubt that President Trump knows what transgender is.
"He supports people who have. He's against gay marriage, and for the right for companies and individuals to discriminate against gays."
"Trump is not using race as an issue? You mean he is welcoming to Blacks, Latinos and Muslims to his rallies? What is the evil agenda that you speak of?"
So imagine a white man making these racists comments about Muslims on campus. Would these same professors put it all on the line in defence of that white guy? The answer is no.
I am far happier and healthier post-transition than I was before.  So are lots of trans people.
"Liberals just changed the game and dropped Motion 6 and are focusing on working together respectfully for all the people and country. memo for all MPs, sunny ways are here again, now back to work and voting like you are paid to be doing."
I find it odd that people think they can negotiate with a religion that wants to cut your head off because you're a Christian.
"The column was amusing, well written, and written with affection -- which is more than I can say about some of the comments."
Some say Pride has always been about Politics NO Pride is not the United Nations it should stick to gay politics - fight for gay rights and not Israel-Palestine unless to support gay rights in Palestine (Israel already has)
"i will lie to you, raise your taxes, increase the debt, and make sure you vote for me brother."
The simple fact is that self-identifying so-called Christians don't even come close to abiding by Christian tenets.  There's no apology for that.  That is better known as just what it is.    Blatant hypocrisy.  And there's no excuse for that.
The Dispatch uses every chance it gets to push their liberal agenda.  Showing a picture of  Kelter down at the gay parade .  Really ?  How pathetic .
We in the West need to concentrate on saving our civilisation. Let the Arabs take care of whatever revolution they favour.
"All forms of hate needs to be eliminated. All forms of racism, Islamophobia, Homophobia, anti-semitism and laws discriminating against Transgenders. We need to get behind Justin, Obama, Hillary and Premier Wynne and fight all forms of hate which includes Trump!"
"Faithful Catholic wrote:  <<I will take Putin's useful idiot, thank you very much...>>  There you have it. Certain authoritarian Catholics are fine with Trump's entanglements with a murderous dictator.  It's disgusting."
You need to get a life. Really!
So this is the 'new wave' of anti-Semitism? Israeli Jews threatening their own around the world?  It never ceases to amaze me how much reality can differ from the propaganda.
"That's your takeaway????No one is saying not to criticize her. Just don't advocate violence against women. That's the difference. And while you're at it, don't advocate violence against any male politicians either"

"@Gibson, you are paying more for Canadian milk, much much more. But you go right ahead. Not everyone wants to follow in your footsteps."
I can give examples of the peaceful Muslim missionaries murdering people 100 to 1 of your examples.  Islam is the religion of death.
Pope Francis talks about walls being bad and then defends Muslims.  Hmmm...
How about FUCK NO. If anything Canada should learn from America's example and start smartening up before this country is overrun by Muslims and Chinese who don't want to learn English.
"Didn't you bother reading my post?  According to your criteria, my son did NOT honor the Church's teaching. He got remarried, and since he and his wife have children, has obviously had sexual intercourse with her.  He LEFT the Catholic Church specifically because of the laws on divorce and remarriage."
Believing in transubstantiation 'because the Pope says so' is just as stupid as believing the earth is four thousand years old 'because the Bible says so.' Both are simply political self-interest couched in supernatural blather.
Most military households say transgender people should get to serve
"if a guy came to our Jummah and started spewing hate and being violent, he would literally have 300 brown and black kids jump at him.” --- Where were those 300 when the PDSB faith advisor hosted an imam calling for slaying of the Jews?"
"He's a man so that won't do.  I was thinking more along the lines of Theresa Spence now that she's looking for work but I'm pretty sure the CBC is hoping to cover all of their bases by hiring a non-white, aboriginal, trans gendered individual."
WOW  Jew hater nice
The same lefty loser 'activists' who 'March for Truth' can't bring themselves to say the words 'Radical Islam' and believe there are 71 genders.  (Or whatever the number is up to now.)
Every one of these hate hoaxes since the election have been staged by Jews themselves
Stop living in the '40s Matt. The rest of us have moved on from this a long time ago...

Why would people be posting about the liberals when Paris just had a tradegy? Can your partisanship know no end???
"Firstly, Jewish is not a religion, it is a race. Secondly, the holocaust claims by Jews has been shown to have been a fraud to extort money from Germany. Google holocaust fraud and you will discover why."
"What about Viagra? A 2016 study by the Rand Corporation found the maximum annual medical costs for transgender services would be around $8.4 million. By comparison, the military spent $84 million on erectile dysfunction medications Viagra and Cialis in 2014, the Military Times reported."
I really believe that Jews are sucking up way too much oxygen of public debate. Not one day goes by we don't hear about some grievance ..or need for special treatment.  All this clamouring for attention 24/7 leads to resentment.

Bush used fake WMD's to go to war.  Clinton wrongly backed Muslim forces in the former Yugoslavia.  Two idiot tough guys who were also POTUS
"No biases, thank you, just a realist.  Maybe he is biased toward Jews.  The fact is, he is ignorant and has a destructive agenda.  Can you imagine the rest of the world putting sanctions on us for destruction of the atmosphere using the Trump policies?"
"And the Republic party just loves its 'blood and soil', 'Jews will not replace us' core driving a car into a crowd and killing a woman. That's the Republic party's definition of a civil society."
I think we need to be careful of the old pupule about the Jews killing Jesus. Jesus and all his disciples were jews. It would be like saying that it was those evil Americans that killed Lincoln because Booth was an American.
integrityAnd yet it isn't in Canada's interest to be so one sided in this conflict-----yet if Harper were ONE SIDED in support of terrorist Hamas you would celebrate and not mind at alladmit it

"That is an utterly ridiculous thing to say, since these poor people were specifically targeted because they were members of the LGBT community.  That would be like saying that Adolf Hitler targeted 6 million people for death in concentration camps in WWII, and failing to mention that they were Jews."

"Sure, all newborns weight the pros and cons, and then make conscious decisions on their sexuality.   Don't you realize how ridiculous that sounds? What you mean is that you were born heterosexual just as those you judge so harshly are born as homosexuals."

Very few people are transsexual. Trustin is just virtue signalling.  There are many groups who are being marginalized in Canada that need more help.

"I haven't mocked Mary.  The Church made up a bunch of falsehoods about her that reflected not her life and her sacrifice, but their own personal issues with women.  Aquinas, for example, believed women, which would include Mary, were malformed men.  How's that for mockery?"
Rockin. You are losing on points so I'm a racist. Good argument.
"Jim Jenkins, for a party that supported slavery, segregation, lynching, Jim Crow, and the current Jew-hating, anti-Semitic, anti-Asian left-wing Black Left....you sure have a big mouth."
Did he then stuff the transgender's penis after castration in the transgender woman's mouth with the head sticking out?
So brave of those who feel Bourque deserves another trial. I wonder how you would feel if you would lose a family member of your families. You would not give a damn about him of that I am sure.
Islamophobia to Muslims is anything that denies or resists the supremacy of Islam. Islam means 'submission' and not to submit to Allah is Islamophobic.
"You just do not get it, dave. It is our right to democratic expression being tampered with and then controlled by exclusion."
"Yay Alceste! Way to go!  Of course, some religions in Canada do warrant support because their adherents are less empowered in Canadian society. Thus, we as Canadians must do more to make those faiths more welcome than, say, tired, antiquated Christianity."
"....if only they could, but why would they when welfare (aka dumb canuck christians paying their $$!)"
"Would love to hear someone say they are sorry for all the Iraqi and Afghani families that have been butchered. Oh, I forgot ... U.S. lives are worth more."
you are so na?ve.
Isn't that the definition of the transexual  tribe? What is the address of this so called community?
"this article reads like an entry in a political-junky teenager's diary. love the part about the evil Jews, too. THAT wasn't predictable at all, was it?"
You may well think that but it's not Catholicism. The Commandments are not guidelines or ideals to be aimed for. And it's the deposit of faith these Cardinals are defending. Conscience isn't 'supreme'; the Truth is. Not even Pope Francis is teaching that.
"You do realize that Iran and Russia are allies, right?.... and that ISIS is Sunni muslim and one of its top goals is to eradicate Shia muslims (which the ruling group in Iran)? ISIS and Iran are sworn enemies.   Educate yourself!"
"Are you aware that is illegal in most EU countries to mention the ethnicity of the subject on the arrest report or incident report?  Rapes are up dramatically, mostly by Muslim men.  But it's politically incorrect to say so."
Canadians don't want a lisping prime minister who's probably bisexual.
"As this nation has gone way right of center in the GOP there is nothing worse than a Christian on a 'mission' and I don't mean Africa, I mean to serve as a US Politician."
One must remember that arrogant condescension and proselytizing is what has given fundamentalists and evangelicals a VERY BAD NAME.  One can't preach/practice bigotry and call themselves a Christian.  That's called being a hypocrite.
I respect your right to have a different opinion.
Better he survived to deprive him of his vestal virgins in Islamic heaven.  Let rot in the calaboose!
"Serafim Saovskii, your hatred of Jews has evolved over time in its manifestations and disguises and one can see all three forms in abundance here. Read some history and maybe you'll understand a thing or two about reality. Your antisemitism is disgusting."
Tell that to all the children beaten by nuns im covent run schools a orphanages over the past 2000 years if the christian sects.  Women who beat children into submission....
"Dear AlbertansYes, we feel your pain, and wish you well. Remember, misery never lasts for ever. This Easterner will never say ?let those western baaastards freeze in winter?. You are valuable to us in good times and bad. Get well soon. Best wishes."
"Skeexix, Kinda like the TRANS people who mutilate their bodies.............."
secularism is also an American concept. Sometimes we can learn from them
"Motely, your recent cheap shots on gay people contain outrageous lies, misinformation, and zero evidence. You've convinced me to add another description to the growing List of Your Character Flaws - Racist, Misogynist, and now Extreme Homophobe"
"You can't mention Sharia law or you will get your account deleted.  People don't want to know that female genital mutilation, misogyny, and throwing gays off buildings exist under Sharia law.  It dispels the myth of multicultualism."
But you believe a few deranged Muslims represent the remaining 1.7 billion?
"Interesting correlation, gay men and divorcees.  It kinda pains me to ask, but would you mind explaining that one?"
The adamant atheist is no better than the fanatically religious. They both claim to just know.
Oh yes More Gun control is the answer right? I know we forgot that the Gun drove itself to the scene and met the shooter there.
Good point - but not so easy to do if you are an Anglophone in Quebec.....
I always find it amusing that non Christians are the first to demonize Christians.

"I hope everyone can find a home in the RCC.  They should also thoroughly understand the Church's teachings against sin, including homosexual behavior."
"If all the left has to offer are homophobic and misogynistic attacks on Leitch, she needs to be very careful.  A protest banner will soon lead to possible hate crimes from this bunch of left wing deplorables."
The medical cost argument is just a distraction. DTs base followers just hate transgendered people and they don't care what the reason is as long as their hatred is somehow legitimized.
"Cheetolini wants to ignore his duties, and is a racist pig.  Plain and simple.  He can't fake care like he does when he fake prays and gullible blind American 'christians' gobble it up."
I can't imagine a biological woman who is trans-gendering to a man feeling safe in some men's bathrooms...more potential for problems and don't we have enough of those already.
Poor baby. Those Kardashians have it so rough. Pretty soon Kanye will be announcing he is transgendered just to get attention.
Who else expects this to be the work the seventh century death cult known as Islam! Brotherhood of peace and love!
"Nothing like starting the car and throw into gear right away at -20, this should do wonders to the tranny and engine."
"Welcome to the 2000s. We will legislate to protect the stupid, instead of letting the stupid face consequences of their actions."
"If their deeds do not match their words, their deeds show us who these hierarchs really are. They are not serious about dealing with the evil pedophile scandal. This is another reason why a future iteration of  Catholic Christianity will be one without  clergy."
"Um liberal lies ... White extremists have killed twice as many U.S. citizens on American soil than Islamic extremists have. I wouldn't call it a 'liberal lie' either. When it's a documented statistic, it's just a fact. Please educate yourself, then you might actually contribute to society."
"Pope F. certainly is not a pope to resolve clergy sex abuse of children in CI (Catholic Institutional)  church! Rather, he will help close down CI church! At this point, it will be better if he will do his job sooner rather then later, so people can start a new!"
"Oh please, 'Jews will not replace us' is false news. Listen to the audio, and then remove the pacifier."
Ah yes !! The G & M elite's version of 'freedom of opinion'. Just a FEW times for moi as well !!
"There is no freedom to dissent from church teaching on abortion, contraception, gay marriage, divorce and remarriage, sex outside of marriage, women's ordination, etc.'  Really, F.C?  So it is only the pelvic issues that really matter?  That explains plenty about the nature of your posts."
Transgender soldiers can kill just as efficiently as straight soldiers.
"Just like your election of Trump explains the sharp rise in hate crimes against minorities, women, gay people, Dems, liberals and immigrants post-election."
I wish we could deport American Catholics who play censor on comboxes.     Censoring comments because you disagree with them....how incredibly lame.
You ignored skyofblue's point: that the groundwork for the now-accepted notion that every person has intrinsic worth and dignity was set by religious folks. The fact that Church hierarchy worked hand in hand with kings is another matter completely.
Overwhelmingly calls itself Christian.
"LOL...yeah...you're right...there IS no swamp, North Korea is NOT a threat, Iran is NOT a threat, moslem terrorists are NOT islamic terrorists, the list goes on..... nice comeback."
Meanwhile back at the Ranch Wynne and Justin are stressing more diversity and the tricky subject of public washrooms (transgender issue).  Stay tuned!!!!!!!
And The Republicans have funnelled the $ to their friends. With The Tea Party saying it's not enough ...A down turn and the cupboard is bare. Definately 'World Class' in the current political environment.
"how many internationally famous musicians (violinist, pianists...)are jewishthey must be doing something right"
You have absolutely no evidence that mortgage fraud is THRIVING in Canada. You have anecdotal evidence and even that is flimsy. It just a nice story that brings some drama to the business page. Not very responsible reporting if you ask me.
"Again, your whinge is 'gay sex is icky'."
"And remember, both ABC and WaPo are zealous Hillary supporters."
Why should I care that believers speak 'blithely' about there being a god? What does it matter? They can believe that to their dying day if they want -- and proclaim it -- and the rest of us will get on with our lives..
Calling yourself a patriot and talking like you do is mimicking Rush Limbaugh. Does not put you in a good light.
"What a nice guy, how thoughtful of him! Lets go bigger, lets give him the Nobel Peace Prize."
People who have questioned Islam have been killed for it.
I think they do co-exist peacefully. It's other Catholics who seem to think it's any of their business that seem to be the problem.
"Go to a volunteer force that are called in for bonafide fires while a core of say 4 professionals 2, 12 hour shifts to avoid the sleeping, who will respond to the medical emergencies and fire rescues. It would save millions and be as effective."
God Bless the Kid. Our nation was founded by young hardcore asskickers. Not liberal transgender pussies.
"they tend to obsess over what we do so much, it is all in their heads.  they are the ones thinking about it over and over and over again.  way much more than we gay people do."
Anything I have commented on I have seen first hand. For the record my respect is earned... No doubt a foreign concept to a second nations supporter.
You and pretty much every person that is in favor of the baker discrimination do not get it. Political thought is not protected. In Colorado sexual orientation is protected.   Bottom line? You do not have to make a cake for a democrat. You have to make a cake for a gay person.
"Yes...that explains why they are killing each other. I know if we in Canada were attacked, the firat thing I would do is kill my Catholic neighour. NOT!!!"
"Organize like the LGBTs did!? Are you serious? That's your best example? How about organized groups like Republicans for Trump, the KKK, Westboro Baptist Church and Anchorage Baptist Temple? Those groups are the ones I fear because they're hate-driven, not gay people."
Unless I am 'cis' and I have low T ....then I have no way to be competitive.   Why can't everyone raise their testosterone to a pre-agreed level?   . transgendered athletes are allowed to raise their testosterone - why not everyone?
"Yes, there is no question that modern Muslim advances in the sciences have been suppressed and ignored by the racist Nobel committee.  To set the record straight I am including an exhaustive list of those breakthroughs below:"
"Of course you can, but know that in doing so you reveal your own personal obsession with the anus.  Are you gay?"
"Monica, there is an excellent treatise on sex written by two  non-clerical theologians: 'THE SEXUAL PERSON: Toward a Renewed Catholic Anthropology' by Todd Salzman and Michael Lawler. 'In short, say Salzman and Lawler: emphasize relationships, not acts, and recognize Christianity's historically and culturally conditioned understanding of human sexuality.' http://press.georgetown.edu/book/georgetown/sexual-person"
Palestinians wanting peace? That's like ISIS wanting peace. Their resistance is in the toilet. Just look at their surroundings and what their resistance has achieved. Rubble and squalor.
"Ascalepius, I doubt it. Hahahhahahahahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaa."
Sorry about not saying Islam is in no conceivable way involved in these murders.
"St. Augustine has certainly messed things up regarding sexuality. Abortion is faced in the Catholic Church BECAUSE sex is ONLY for procreation!'  The better/best outcome of “sex” is “procreation” of life. Or, would you say it is not?"
"Lesbian nuns arise! Demand equal mistreatment, now!!!"
Islam is not compatible with dutch values and i am pretty sure the dutch do not want to convert. It is all or nothing for the muslims and they will not stop until they have it all.  The elites refuse to except that reality.
"Bottom line here:  Islam isn't trusted, so a Muslim-only cemetery is suspect.  No explanation needed for this lack of trust.  Most people know the 'why'."
Great?  2 homosexual males using surrogate mother(2) produce another homosexual male or lesbian or more homosexual males and/or lesbians.
Because it's impossible to align a transgendered individual's mind with their body.  Male and female brains are different - they're composed of different types of cells and they think with different parts of the brain.
Tell someone who cares Save Trudeau
"i don't need your 'compassion,' thanks."
"The idea of a homosexual orientation (as opposed to heterosexual men indulging in same-sex 'acts') is surprisingly modern, is it not?"
LMAO! The Alberta Party is a bunch of extreme left-wing nutjobs. No one credible would ever associate themselves with collection of clowns.
"Jews are scared because the terrorists lobbing bombs and launching rockets on Israel, are gaining ground in Europe."

Change the childs mind about what? Being LGBTQ? Or just thinking that LGBTQ people don't deserve to be treated any differently than anyone else? And what 'real issues' are you referring to? There is nothing not 'real' about being LGBTQ.   Spare us your veiled homophobia.
It still seems to come down to dislike/hatred of Jews; not much has changed in Europe and it is the same here in Canada.  And the comments here are the nicer ones that have not been blocked by the Globe's civility policy.
Saudi Arabia is going to execute a man for being an atheist.  We don't need more 'Muslim values' like these here in Canada.
"This is the second terrorist bomb to be set off in Manchester in recent years. If memory serves, the last one was set off by Catholics."
In other words: He's not gay!  Right?
Muslims are the ones who suffered this particular terrorist attack.  Six were shot to death by two gunmen while they were praying.  You should perhaps consider reading more than just the title of a news article.
"You need a citation to a source that supports your very specific claim, that liberals (as a whole) like/love (whatever) ALL Muslims and that ALL Muslims treat women as property. Good luck!"
"Let's not forget that other adorable example of good Christianity, the Salem Witch Trials. Let's hang 'em in the name of God!"

"Thank you Konrad for an insightful article. Greece and Greeks, with their congenital hubris, are always quick to point the finger of blame at others."
"Yes, time to move forward, respect right and the rule of law, not try to enforce a monoculture on other people."
Now we just need gay orgs to take responsibility for the fact that 4 out 5 church abuse cases were the work of gay priests abusing boys.  I call that fair play and honesty.
"It's hard, well perhaps not so hard to humiliate a Jew hater. It comes with their mother's milk and their narrow education, and only serves to reinforce Israel's need for a Jewish state and minimizing the prospects of a terrorist state on its border."
"Don't worry, this Catholic Institution will be dismantled before all other changes!!! You don't graft a new branch to a dead rootstock!"
Mrs Gagnon never used the word ?madness? in her article in La Presse. Shame on the G&M!
It's rich for a Muslim to call sovereignty a hate crime.  Muslims don't integrate well as seen in Europe. Why? They dont respect national sovereignty.

Dear Western Society: Hosea 8:7
Are you implying that it's appropriate that Muslims should be targeted in the USA because non-Muslims have difficulty practising their faiths in Muslim countries?
"That any Catholic, Christian, or American would consider voting for a racist demagogue like Trump is shameful."
I would love to see you stand in the face of a transgender person and compare something as inmate as their identity  to having psoriasis or being overweight.  I could further pick apart your analogy but it's really not necessary because it's ridiculous.
Why did the music 'badly need change after VII'? Why is that? Just for the sake of change? Why should any Catholic Church ever allow something out of schismatic Taize to be heard within its walls?
"Yes, I do have a question, franco prairie.  You call Justin Trudeau 'gender fluid.'  That sounds homophobic to me.  Can you explain it?"
"With 325,886, 603 people in the US (three seconds ago) and 'One birth every 8 seconds and One death every 11 seconds', one 'transgender' critter more or less is really irrelevant!  https://www.census.gov/popclock/"
"Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric have all married into the Jewish community.    All of Trump's grandchildren are Jewish.  Everything he has done so far has been self serving, why end at religious intolerance and bigotry?"
It's cute when you try and do man things.
"Trudeau much prefers the Muslims-as-victims narrative.  Indeed, his response after Muslim attacks has been to preach 'Don't blame all Muslims for the acts of a few'."
"Mormons cannot possibly be gay.  We just can't have this, and that's the end of that.  /s"
The Mormon  church is making itself obsolete. In the long run. This issue may cause a cysm in the church. Once side will accept homosexual and prosper. The other will die. Isn't this what the Bible says happens to sinners?
"Imagine President Hillary, Commander in Chief of our transgender military, dealing with North Korea's nuclear ambitions. She might be selling us out to the Chinese for campaign cash for her 2nd term election, Yeah..she's that evil and power hungry. Thank God she lost."
"Amy Demboski, your neighbors might be having gay sex. shouldn't you be putting a stop to that? thanks Eagle River, you're the deep south of Anchorage. the toothless inbred deep south."
I totally disagree with this editorial....looking after one's interest is not provincialism-whatever that means- it is realism
"Absolutely so!  However, a transgirl is entirely different from your son.  Transgirls are insistent, persistent and consistent about their gender identity.  It is NOT a preference or a like for 'pretty things'."

Why the hell do Muslims want to come to Canada if we are such a despicable bunch of racist kurrs?  Oh but they forgive us and try to accept us.   How magnanimous.  How much of their objection to us is just taqiyya?
Errors on the part of individual priests' ignorance or poor judgment cannot be imputed to the Church's teaching or to Christ's divine command.
"I've never noticed that kindergartners have (trans) gender hang-ups. If they do though, don't worry, they'll likely outgrow it once they've moved beyond functional illiteracy. How's that going for you, 4:20?"
I'm not sure sending a Jewish guy to solve the ME problem is a good idea. Is that really going to be well received by the Palestinian side?
In 1944 18 year olds stormed the beaches of Normandy in the face of certain death to free Europe. In 2016 18 year olds need a safe place to protect themselves from getting their feelings hurt.
If you need to claim you're world class - you're not. Toronto pols haven't figured that out.
"A gay person who supports Trump?  Oh, I forgot.  There's also that Milo guy.  The basket overflows."
 'Patriot'? What does that mean? '  'The ownership disqualifies it...' is what answers that. Levant is Jewish and 'patriot' is code for neo-nazi et al.
Utter nonsense. Only the religious ignore overwhelming evidence of the absurdity of their beliefs yet pride themselves on their blind faith.
so you read the contract or do you just make excuses for the sunny ways Justin?? He does have nice hair so I get your attraction to him but try to think on your own
"If they're silent, they're not giving scandal, are they?  But that really wasn't your point.  I think you just wanted to remark that some priests and religious might be gay...  ..and being gay, of course (although you neglect to mention it) is NOT reason to deny a public funeral."
"Nepotism, you think?  But his appointment would qualify as diversity since a lot of Trump's supporters do not consider Jews as white."
"This is the new age Canada now, workers rights have been eroding rapidly.  Consider having a sex change, claim to be homosexual/lesbian or develop some deviant mental disorder if you want any type of workplace protection - sorry folks, I'm dead serious on this one."
Never read in any newspaper of a pervert dressing like a transgender and going into a bathroom for the purpose of molesting someone.  Most parents escort their child into the bathroom.
"Islamic radicals, like mad dogs, bite themselves, along with everyone & everything else."
"... liberals gently neighing as they seek to tax hard working Americans in order to pay for the sex change operations of transgender jihadists ... '   OMG, SD - please don't give them any ideas!!  =:-o"
Fr. Martin is becoming Moses-like.  Pinning the snake of homosexuality and mounting it high on a pole.  Bringing it out of the darkness of unconscious fear.
"Of course transgendered people could be a risk, as could anybody else.  Ask Edward Snowdon.   Linking sex to military security in the modern age is a huge stretch.  Blackmail is no longer particularly effective."
"it is more a case of law in muslim countries.  Women cannot say anything about any man,  let alone the leader.  Get used to it. The ideology is marching unopposed."
I should add that I think it's immoral and a scandal to pressure homosexuals into pseudo-heterosexuality.
"I'm more worried about my child sitting on a soiled (urine, feces, blood, etc) toilet seat than of a transgender person occupying same bathroom. Please get over yourselves."
"Especially if that joy includes living your parent's basement. But then on the bright side, maybe their parents will have someone there to help them in their old age, although I wouldn't bet on it."
Go to a Muslim country and that's exactly what they do and they do it in public. Or if you are lucky they chop off your hand.
the hypocracy of the LGBT... advocates at womens shelters and related organizations who refuse to accept trannies born as males. apparantly only the trannies born as females get their (our)  financial and emotional support
"And comes now Donald Trump being welcomed by major evangelicals of America, most if not all racists themselves, some even member of the Ku Klux Klan, to embrace and cheer each other on. Holy cow!"
"quiet honey, the men are talking"
"What would happen if the U.S.A. simply backed out and let the Palestinians, other Muslims and Israel sort out their problems?   Why does the U.S. government think it has to support Israel?  Why does the U.S. government think it's so important  to support Israel?"
"Easy! Get rid of the snowflake socialist stooges that whine about everything, and make little puddles on the ground when things don't go their way."
"Ezra is an insecure, self-hating, Jew.  He looks for acceptance amongst the worst of society.  His heritage means nothing to him.  Most Jews have disowned him."
"Allie, the transgender troops who served America well did so as men and women consistent with their sex at birth.   Allowing them to now serve in the sex with which they identify is beyond insane.  It is liberalism run amok."
The solution is simple. Open your eyes and your heart. It is not so hard as you think...
Dalton McGuinty was a puppet of the teacher's unions.
Yes of course. But will the natives actually give the AFN the authority to make binding agreements with the Feds ??? Not too likely !!! Therefore more of the same unending bullcrap forever.
"Interesting take. I'm sure you won't have a problem with US track and field sprint/power events being taken over by trans women, then?"
"really, truly desperate. sad."
So trans-gendered people cannot defend the US and fight? Used to say that about black people and women. Discrimination is discrimination.
"I don't feel like he represents me. He won't condemn those groups specifically, yet he has no trouble condemning foreign terrorists, undocumented workers, and Islamic terrorists. So no, he most certainly does NOT 'represent all Americans.'"
The U.S armed Islamic psychopaths in Afghanistan during the 80's to fight Russia.  The U.S arms Islamic psychopaths in Syria during this war to fight Russia.  Nothing much has changed....
Especially the United Way and it's member agencies!
I am ashamed to be a Catholic today with this social activism gone wild.
Here is a thoughtful critique of the TV show in question from a trans blogger: https://sexdrugsmh.wordpress.com/2017/01/13/thoughts-on-transgender-kids-who-knows-best/
When the commander-in-chief says:  'After consultation with my Generals and military experts please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military' - I believe that technically makes the President himself the credible source.
We agree then.   Although Trump says he is a Christian -he is far from it -  just another lie from the bully.
"So Comrade, I guess you haven't heard about breitbart trying to boycott Kellogg's? Or RWNJ's boycotting Starbucks because their cups are christmasy enough? Or millionmoms boycotting Target, Penney's et al for not discriminating against gays? Yeah, it's just liberals."
"You forgot gettingvthe sisters back into habits, getting sent to hell for a hot dog on Friday and all Catholics wearing at least one scapular 24/7.  Oh, and getting rid of girl altar boys."
"When someone, especially an elected official uses their power to cause personal unrest to another individual or population by accusing them of being linked to Muslim terrorists, you've lost your right to free speech.  How's it feel to have your pants on backwards?"
"And furthermore, Jesus may have been dogmatic, particularly regarding hypocrites, but he never said a single world about homosexuality. Not. One. Word."
Free enterprise will always be with us
But...but...but...they are closed on Sundays and protest gay marriage.  They must wallow in morality!  This is surely a mistake.
Typical of Ms Wente....just pick the data that supports her point and don't bother doing any more research or analytical work than she has to.
"I really hope you're right! I'm not a tech idiot, but this situation is making me feel pretty vulnerable."
"Christ the Lord is risen again, hallelujah......'  Oh look!  Plastic eggs from a helicopter!!!!  He is risen!"
"The league is asleep at the wheel. Either way, this was going to end up in court, so instead of having to deal with controversial transgender politics, they should have simply disqualified Beggs on the basis of her/him using a banned performance-enhancing substance."
A lot of other people are also being massacred in the Middle East. They are called Muslims.
Plenty of white anglo saxon born again narrow-minded judgemental bigoted Christians have had their educations paid for by the same over-privileged white people. Stop whining and learn to be the tolerant civic-minded person this country is so proud of.
"We need a politician like Donald Trump , who says what most people are thinking"
",,I take,, it you,, are a,,,Trump,,,supporter?!?"
You were just as much as females who couldn't become firefighters because of the physical requirements.
The question should be is our military stronger or weaker with transgender recruits.  I vote weaker.
@Tron4000-  Yea people don't change after 40 years... Hillary opposed gay marriage for decades.  Chances are there was some point in your life when you used to call someone a 'fag'... by your logic you're homophobic.
"Ah yes, the liberal architects of the oil war in Afghanistan, security certificates, Maher Arar, torture, rendition, etc... How nice, they have something to say on how not to do it."
"Nothing ironic about it at all.  They hate everyone who isn't a greedy, lying, white Christian, old man.  They have never had and morals or values since day one."
"They were chanting 'Jews will not replace us,' not 'You will not replace us.' Apart from the odious political message, I find the thought of being in a big, sweaty man-crush quite repellent."
"Not sure if you're willfully blind to your attitude, or if you really don't know what condescension means."
"I've had several people tell me they think Mike Pence is gay, although my gaydar never even wiggles when I see the man.  If gay, he must hate himself an awful lot.  Even more than Ted Haggard."
Trump is most likely homophobic due to a deep-seated embarrassment over his longtime homosexual relationship with his gay mentor Roy Cohen...
"how many relatives have you lost to Nazi ? What the f... wrong with you ? How the hell you can compare Donald to Adolf ? Did he kill millions of Jews, Poles or Russian ?"
So Hitler was anti jew because he left alone 50 percent of the Jewish people in the world? The KKK isn't racist because they leave black people in Africa alone? You have a high bar for discrimination.
"Well, considering that her party hates Jewish people, she fits right in."
"Good for them!  Thank you for being there, ladies.  Pence is a conservative Christian prig who likes nothing better than “keeping them barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen.”  Save us should the likes of him become President....."
"That would be apostasy to question Islam,  and they would kill her  if she did that."
"If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, chances are it’s a duck"
every day now another puff piece of muslims
Noone cares what you think
The governing association got that part right but failed to realize that these transgenders are taking steroids to accomadate their sex change which also gives them a physical advantage. By not disqualifying herself this girl was basically cheating and being unethical.
Jews willnot replace us.'
YOU NEVER USE GOOGLE EARTH? DON'T USE GOOGLE. I GET ADS FOR TRIPS TO CUBA ALL THE TIME. AND OLD AGE HOMES. SO WHAT? YOU WANT THE INTERNET TO COST NOTHING? THERE MUST BE ADS.
"I dont get it.  To date, all Israeli Jews; black/brown/white/Sephardi/Ashkenazi share a single space with separation between the sexes.  What rationale is there to demand being different and have a separate section for anyone or anything?"

"I didn't see any females at any of our the Pride parades wearing a hijab, niqab or burqa.'  And none of the drag queen queens either, presumably. Clearly, the gay community hasn't adopted a diversity approach."

The BDS movement and the anti-Israel propaganda disseminated on our country's university campuses has unleashed the worst in people on the political left. The anti-Jewish bigots of the left feel emboldened as they hide behind the billowing skirts of Auntie-Semitism.

Muslims do not assimilate. Muslims infiltrate. It is called 'Hijrah' (jihad by immigration).

"The RCC is simply an institution bent on profit and power.'  There is a special place for those who malign the Church that Catholics hold dear, and a special ignominy in being once a Father of Church and saying such things."

Being respectful toward other people has been labeled 'political correctness' by those on the right. You have misunderstood the point.
"Actually, gender reassignment is neither cheap nor easy. But what do you care? You have decided that psychological knowledge has not advanced in 50 years, which combined with your easy dismissal of the transgendered shows that you don't actually care about real people with real problems."
Voting for Hillary and being Catholic is an oxymoron .  Abortion is an abomination in the eyes of God.

Another conservative family-values politician goes down again.  Interesting how almost all of these conservative family-values people eventually get caught with their pants down.  At least  he was  only a Baptist Deacon and not a Catholic priest or Catholic Bishop sexually molesting innocent little boys.
Back to the Supreme Court of Canada. The judge was correct. Make the Catholics pay for their own faith-based religucation.
So who are you to determine what forms of correction are legitimate? You must have some qualification beyond being a busybody liberal.
Trump’s Navy Secretary On Transgender Troops: ‘Any Patriot’ Should Serve

Right and wrong actually exist. Comparing the systematic murder of over 6 million Jews alone to Elvis is beyond foolish. We don't need any 'dialogue' about Naziism.

If probably more than half the priests are gay why are they against gay people and their marriage rights? Are they angry they can't gay marry?

Instead, he used all of his time very well...serving others.   Argument emptied."

Thank you for your service and may God keep all our military service members SAFE.
Star_Chaser - 'The most bigoted people I have seen here are the Harper haters.'Just like Israelis and Jews who oppose the policies of the Israeli government are 'anti-Semites'? Your attempts to criminalize political opinion are pathetic.
Canadians won't be in a position to say 'we have made amends' for at least a generation AFTER the government has demonstrated it is treating aboriginal people with respect. That has only just started after a decade of going backwards.

"forwhatisworth, When these people started 50 years ago to want to kill all Jews and continue to think like that instead of negotiating a settlement they deserve what they have. Terrorists are terrorists and desrve to live in ruins."

"Nothing but fears and jeers, Gay.  Keep whining."
"Trump's banning of transgendered people was certainly arbitrary but I don't think it will have a drastic effect on LGBTQ rights, especially not in Canada.  Their rights are too entrenched now. They have become unshakeable like the rights of women."
"That will be happening here in Canada very soon.... as a matter of fact, it may be going on right now.  In Richmond Hill there is a Muslim-only housing community where it's forbidden to walk your dog on a public street."

 I don't see the death of Western Christianity as a bad thing ' .  It doesn't get much more pathetic than that.
Baloney! Separate school boards in Alberta feature prayers and Catholic religious courses. Holidays at Christmas and Easter are Christian celebrations. You'd do better to hide your prejudices and keep your shallow thoughts to yourself.

Pedophilia? Hmmm? Catholic much?
Catholicism certainly. They were expert terrorists.

The power of the LGBT gang is terrifying. If transgender do not identify themselves it is deceptive to a person who is hoping for a normal opposite sex relationship. The surprise and embarrassment that would come after unclothing is shocking!
Agree.  Can't see what all the fuss is about having a gay scene and gay character.  Especially when the main theme of the movie is beastiality.

"Trump is under the opinion that transgender 'bathroom rights'  is an issue to be regulated at the state, not federal, level which I believe to be correct. The Feds have many issues to confront, where a child goes to tinkle at school shouldn't be one of them."

"Of course you'll agree that it didn't cost Putin a dime. And, you'll probably also agree that a good portion of the 52 billion actually went INTO his pocket."
I'm also sure that the Dem support of bathroom options for transgenders didn't help.  Biological males have no business being in female-only spaces.  No means no always - no exceptions.

You have my respect and thanks. (Oncologist in Ontario)
Right because that's what being transgender is. Just waking up every day and claiming to be one sex or another depending on how the mood strikes you. That is exactly how it works.
The truth is that Roman Catholics and Protestants have more in common theologically than they have differences; this needs affirmation and celebration. The differences are predominantly (if not only) ecclesiological. It is ridiculous to allow ecclesiology to dictate relationships...at any level.

What does the Church's TEACHING authority have to do with pedophilia? The 'sex abuse problem' has nothing to do with 'clerical control' other than the lavender mafia admitting far too many homosexuals into seminary.

Anti-Semitism in America is coming from all those useful idiot undergrads and their professors.   They hate Jews and love them some Palestinians.
I guess that they now know that being fellow Muslims counts for nothing when dealing with extremist and criminal elements.
"I was brought up catholic, and the church was quite clear, masturbation was a sin.  It wasted life.  I guess the priests in your parish were a little more uhhm open than in mine."

"Right. A racist, sexist, bigoted, adulterous liar of a president should be supported, and those who voted for him praised.  Previous conservative presidents at least gave lip service to their Christianity. Do you really see Trump doing even that?"

It has always been thus.
Jews were not engaged in terrorism against Germans. Palestinians are engaged in terrorism against Jews.

"Fair point. The sexes are equal. Women has strived for decades to be treated equally. So suck it up when someone treats you equally, but unpleasantly. It's less about your gender, and more about YOU as a person."
"Apparently some of the trans-soldiers feel like they were fired via tweet. In any event, these sorts of communications are not fitting of a true leader. I find them shameful."
"You should try using punctuation. It makes you appear a bit smarter, even when you make a claim that no one can substantiate."
It would be fair enough to do so if large numbers young non-Muslim French men started saying they were there to 'die for Jesus' or the Napoleonic Code while committing crimes.
An ignorant comparison !!! 6 million Jews exterminated just for being Jewish. Truly entering the mind of the left is an exercise in madness.
Entirely different subjects. You might as well blame Jews for Hiroshima because of Einstein.
"The mainstream Jewish organizations in the 1940s were brown-nosing the British. The Irgun drove them out. But as I said, the 1940s are not analogous to today; there are no similarities to today."
"grizzled'? all journos and columnos, including Ms Wente, should retire at 65; hey it's 2016!"
I would presume this move is to stop the transgender from joining the military for paid sex changes on the public dime.
Choose? Are saying that being gay is a choice? That's been debunked decades ago. When did you make your choice as to your sexual orientation?
"That was Brennan, under Obama, not our good American, Christian president.   You really should not make baseless statements to fuel the dopes who believe this nonsense."
You asked who the parents complain too. The answer is the school district.  'The Association of Alaska School Boards is also urging school districts across Alaska to adopt transgender policies. The school districts have to get into the nuts-and-bolts policies.”

"Climatism is a religion with amazing similarities to Catholicism. It has original sin, fires of purgatory, the flood, pestilence and the plague of locusts, sinners, sin and repentance, redemption, guilt and forgiveness, indulgences, incantations, hypocritical priests, agnostics, faithful and the unfaithful."

Inspiring!! First transgendered woman in the pagent!
For The Globe's editorial board to stop being so schizophrenic? I agree with you there.
The police do need evidence of the motivation other than the victim being transgender. The evidence is not in this article so nobody can judge the police's motive from just reading this. Motivation is also hard to come by and is not needed in a clear cut murder case.
why does this old hag of a writer hate visible minorities? Her columns are reliable for taking cheap shots at marginalised groups. Try attacking the Jews in the same fashion and see what happens.
I wonder if Ms. Kinworthy would find it 'educated and reasonable' for the ASAA to adopt the NCAA's policy regarding transgender athletes participation?
"Is the author suggesting that it is OK to align with the  USA that has invaded Iraq, Afghanistan, and drone attacked Pakistan and Yemen etc and a new president who has very racist views on Mexicans and Muslims."
"If a poll were taken of most black people and most gay people, the police would be welcomed. A tiny minority of hardcore black racists like BLM Toronto should not be running our city."
"Was the Jewish community invited to send representatives to this conference?  If not, they should have been."
Lefties are stupid then... because crazy people don't ever get an AR and shoot up San Bernardino or gay nightclubs...  which makes me wonder why are these shooters always LIBERALS?  Grow up.

"I remember in Canada it was not a civilized discussion, but rather rearguard action. The anti-marriage side didn't want civil unions either, until it looked like gay marriage was coming in, and then proposed civil unions as a 'compromise'."
All the issues with men harassing me have been the white men who have voted for Trump.  Working class types who don't seem to follow basic ideas about manners and common decency frighten me more as a woman than some vague scary foreign Muslim threat.
Everyone should be upset with the little potato doper and his billions blown on Communist Chinese 'schmoozing' and flooding the country with Muslims that no one asked for or voted on. But no money for the health care system and citizens in need.Pathetic!

"Oh, look at you, making fun of the way Jewish people talk, thinking you're making a funny joke, that isn't."

Trump is an atheist who manipulates poorly educated evangelicals to his own advantage.  I find Trump easy to see through.  He is a cynical TV entertainer and shibai artist.  So sad to see any Christian fall for his nonsense.
He is no orator and no speech of his will go down in history... his delivery is stiff and halting and when TelePrompTerless he wanders off topic and makes remarks that he regrets later as he did after his red line in the sand speech.

"If Jesus intended to establish NO priesthood and did not--then there is no problem and no argument.  If Jesus established no priesthood and had nothing good to say about it, the problem isn't that the Church won't ordain women, but that the Church is ordaining men."
Orthodox Jewish women are not at risk of being stoned to death or drowned in their car driven off a cliff into a lake  if they disobey.
Last time I checked there wasn't any Jews shouting death to Americans
No mention of an under the table boycott of Target for it's ever increasing leftist policies culminating in outright anger at their transgender bathroom policies.  Not sure what the affect that has been but should have a clearer picture after the others report.
Those events exist. Look at 'black bike week' in Myrtle Beach and all the gay cruises. There is absolutely a double standard. Just try setting up a whites only 'Ivory Awards' to the corresponding blacks only 'Ebony Awards' and see how that would fly.
"Indian are probably the ones who will bury the west once for all, just look at the pace all stuff are outsourced to there, even English."
So the transgender troops expect the military (meaning taxpayers)  to pay for their conversion surgery.

Sure.  Why let facts and reason get in the way?  It's always better to argue a case from a platform of complete ignorance.  Just ignore the fact that transgender people have served for decades.  Why think?  Let me guess .... you're a Trump voter?

"Broglio 'backs transgender ban, but says human dignity must prevail'.    So he backs banning an entire group of human beings, albeit in a humane, dignified manner?!  Jeepers, they looked better fighting for glutenized hosts!  I'm so ashamed.  This is not a 'religion' worthy of supporting."

From the first comments on this thread saying there were too many muslims shown and mocking Trudeau's 'ramadan socks' to the latest claiming Trudeau spoke too long and too loud and disparaging 'teepee' comments - there sure are a lot of miserable people here on a long weekend.
"yeah, it reminds me of the rock band 'the who' kept coming back for another 'farewell' concert. We all love Justine"
It would be easier to understand transgenderism if advocates could provide a definition of what it now means to be a man or a woman. What criteria would someone use to self-determine whether they are male or female gender?
"You know, I have seen a lot more stories about U.S. Congressman misbehaving in public bathrooms then transgender people.  Perhaps they should be the subject of such an ordinance."
Furthermore this has NOTHING to do with hiding taxable income from the U.S. This is absurd. Where are you getting your information?

Homefront support' is purely a social construct with no basis in reality for the vast majority of men. What's obvious and measureable is where the real support is - meeting the needs & wants of women.
The burkini is not a political project'That's what you want people in Canada to believe. Europeans have finally woken up and know it is a political project. Segregated swimming pools for muslim women only are also part of the agenda.
I will also never forget the Shafia women who were murdered by their family members because they just wanted to live like Canadian women. This is where my 'Islamophobia' began.

No. I know LGBTs who have been chased out of the Church. It was made abundantly clear to these 'intrinsically disordered' people that they are neither wanted not welcome in the Catholic Church.

It's also about time that you and your parents and relatives who have settled on lands belonging to the native peoples begin to evacuate and leave just as the UN resolution demands of Jews living in the West Bank. Get moving hypocrite!

One can see a thread of Islam-worship in this article's description of women.
Thank goodness for that. Now if the could only remove Catholic from their name and all would be well.

The fundies I know think of the Vatican and Catholicism as a pedophile ring.
"I also heard that women in Quebec can have prostate surgery, just so they don't feel discriminated against."
You are more likely to die in a bathtub than be killed by a Muslim.  Therefore your fear of taking a shower is rational too.
"Jews culturally appropriated it -consider it NYC pidgin.'  Oy vey, now that's not kosher:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQhwNtY3N2k"
Bannon has already returned to harassment of Jews.
"But under the law. a gay baker could not refuse service to someone on the basis of religion, national origin, race, color, or sex. The law should treat EVERYONE equally."
Why  don't you ask your buddy Fred? He wrote the very first comment about 'gay sex and male genitalia.'  I just assumed you two are an item.
Absolutely. RCMP now to allow women to wear the hajib. Is this what Canada is becoming? A country dictated by immigrants how Canadians must change to suit them?
"My reading of the statement at issue is that the Roman Catholic school board condones a man forcing his wife to have sex, because marriage trumps consent."

Due to lack of Muslims Hawaii is not so dangerous YET.
"Contempt for the military?'  Damn straight.  How'd 'the military' discover they weren't going to add any more transgender'd personnel?  The same way, at the same time, everyone else did: through a Presidential tweet.    I'd hate to be a member of the Joint Chiefs right now."
Do these girls face genital mutilation as they do in Islamic cultures?
Trump and his Jewish son in law will never give the Palestinians an even footing. Allie is right on this one.
So substitute 'gay' with 'colored'
Many eye-witnesses do not corroborate the officer's story. If fact they say it was the officer who attacked Brown. And yes it does add up. The police have started to kill unarmed innocent civilians at a alarming rate.
Yup. Why did the Church stop talking about sodomy (homo- and heterosexual) as sinful?
Great perseverance story.  Not sure what relevance being gay has on any of it.  If everyone was hetero would they have even mentioned it?
"Keith D LaRiviere are you referring to the trillion dollar give away, please sit down and read"
self hating jews I guess. There are millions of jews  who are anti-zionists which must make things awkward at times for the non semitic zionists who currently run things in Israel
Remember: empathy is what inspired the shooters in Dallas and Baton Rouge.

All that needs to be done is an end to medical payments for any transgender care in the military.  That will reduce the small number of transgenders in the military from pursuing gender transition.
"Trump is right on the money!  We don't need or want islamic terrorists coming here!  These people hate the West, our way of life and the simple fact we are not muslims!  That does not make for good citizens!"
"Yes, jots and tittles, crossed Ts and dotted Is. This is a bishop who wants simultaneously to single out the gay members of his local church for specific opprobrium and distance himself from the directive by which he's doing it.  Deplorable."

No Duke! The Liberal are on the ground training the Kurds fighting against ISIS. That where they are needed most. Did you have your coffee yet? lol

"I lost what little respect I had for Mulroney when he stood by Peladeau as he announced his ambition to separate from Canada. With Brian, money always goes before integrity and honour and loyalty. I am sure he will do well - for himself."
"Isn't it disgusting? These people commenting, and the Liberals clearly don't know how to use a dictionary. None of this makes any sense. Everyone wants to protect the religion of Islam, and they care nothing about the muslims. That's exactly what I see here."
Coming up soon? Trump executive order that all Jewish centres remove the Israeli flags from premises.
you seem like a real likeable guy! No wonder your mum abandoned you at birth
I think I understand you now. It's only free speech if a paper publishes what you can agree with. right?
"It's not a function of cultural relativism - gender equality, secularism, and personal freedoms are better than cultures that subjugate women, have draconian religious-based laws, and restrict personal freedoms."
"Fine, rid all evidence of Christianity from Canada. Just remember, this must result in all religions being expunged from the public school system. No more prayer rooms for certain members of society."
"In fairness, the COUNTRY isn't second class. Just the current government, and I'd say calling them second-class is a compliment of extravagant proportions. Really, they are class-less, as in devoid of all class."

"Yes, I agree with your assessment, good job Obama in destroying any voter base the democrats once enjoyed among jewish American voters for the next few years or longer."
Interesting that they would target an event that was overwhelmingly being attended by women and young girls.  There are virtually no male victims of this gruesome terror attack.  What does this say about these reactionary Muslims who believe in Jihad??
"As you read the gripping reactions of the Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, it makes the idiotic and insensitive remarks made by Sean Spicer on Passover even more grotesque as he refers to the camps as Holocaust Centres. Like somewhere you would gather to for a spa day."
Just wait for FN to have a confrontation  with Muslims over land (like for a cemetery)  and not  enough  white people left to come to FN defence.
Because nobody believes these nutcases have anything to do with mainstream Christianity.
"MGWhat do you think of Canada attacking a completely innocent Muslim country? Would retaliation surprise you? It seems most appropriate that Muslims would try to disrupt the source of the invasion, namely Parliament Hill."

"Bloggins, who pays you to spew such rubbish. You come across as a fool."
"The Vatican pundits called cooperation between Catholics and other Christians, largely for the sake of prolife issues, an 'ecumenism of hate.'   Might just be the wackiest thing out the Vatican since HV."
The larcenous crowd at Queen's Park has virtually ignored Don's World.
Donald Trumps states people should “use the bathroom they feel is appropriate.” (April 2016)  Donald Trump revoked landmark guidance to public schools letting transgender students use the bathrooms of their choice. (Feb 2017)  So which news is fake Donald?
When does it end when people like you stop the hate and bullying and killing Transgender humans and learn how to be more for Human rights
"And, if you even bothered to read the diagnostic criteria (which you didnt), requires anxiety and distress resulting from misidentification of gender at birth due to psychological, behavioral, and biological causes. Transgender is not a disease or mental disorder under any clinical diagnostic in the US. Period."
Only sexist men think feminism is an organized religion. Feminism is for people who believe in equality of women. You clearly don't.

"Yes, your claim that only Jesus is God is rubbish, and I'm glad you have recognized and, hopefully, repented.  I hope you will next discard and repent of the idolatry of worshiping a man-made institution as Divine."
Yeah that was the remark that offendedme most. Trivializing malfeasance andelectoral fraud among other things is sotypically arrogant of Ms. McDougall.
"It's over, Trump won because the Democrats put climate change, anti-American activist groups and transgender bathrooms ahead of the hard working middle class. It's as simple as that. Russian activity had no influence, whatsoever."
like baird stepping into a coffee shop in east Jerusalem semantics or establishing falsehoods as facts on the ground semantics?
Did you read the article? Can you read and comprehend?
If I understand your comment correctly you are right.  'Strident professed militant Catholic' is their self proclaimed mission.  The group think is on their part and it's powerful in keeping them in the fold and donating money.
"From some of the comments it would seem that Canada's historical behaviour towards , say east European, Irish and Jewish immigrants, should be copied here as well. Let's not do the knee jerk conservative values thing again. It doesn't mean we have to be idiots, just not mean spirited psycho's."

"The bottom line is that the Security Council countries see the rest of the world as Muslim dominated with demonstrated terrorist aspirations, and have opted to feed the Muslim crocodile in the hope of being eaten last."
An order of the commander-in-chief on a ban on transgender is just that -  an order from the Commander-In-Chief.   This is the military we are talking about where orders from the top do not contain even a single information on how to accomplish the task.

"There is nothing to reconcile. The two are intractible, church: 'intrinsically disordered' and LGBT person: 'I am'."

Ah yes. Trying to mock him for being an amazing family man. How will he recover.
"IRT FastEddie, agree with your post.  The Congress must repeal such nonsense where citizens (tax payers) must pay for any transgender surgery.  For some reason Congress and Hawaii born ex-president Obama created another human form besides a man and a woman.  Auwe."

"Me too Neko.  Good Lord the gay brings out the worst in some 'TradCaths' understanding of Christianity.  And yes, I am definitely making a distinction between Christians and self proclaimed traditional catholics."

They do and have been for a very long time. Look it up lmfao
What about Catholic  prelates telling us we can now disregard those 10 commandments?
"tories will never give compassion instead of contempt, but it would be nice if they recognized the points you make here. Harm reduction is a much better approach than shaming and demonizing."
"It does not matter which name you use john, joannie, JOE or maybe ???, the result will be the same unless you change, namely purgatory, probably preceded by psychological problems."
"They want God to bend around their will.'  When you say 'they', RD, are you including yourself? As when you show your basic misunderstanding of and contempt for the transgendered."
To me accommodation of religion and culture is a Canadian value as enshrined in our Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Before Trump got elected I would have agreed with youBut its impossible to imagine Trump doing anywhere near as good as Obama did on foreign policy
"My interpretation of Trump's decision is based on the financial burden placed on taxpayers for the gender transition. Here's an idea, start a go fund account to support transgender transition for those in the military, that way taxpayers won't have to pay for the enormous medical expenses...everybody wins."
"Don't forget a value added tax (sales tax) of 23%. But yes, very well spent, and I would be happy to pay it to see those around me well cared for and disparities in social class minimized."
How much land does Arabs need? It's not about the land but murderous hate towards HaShem's chosen people...The Jews. The Lord has set a blessing(Torah) and a curse(secularism) before us...Choose wisely!

Why?  He's not gay.   Huh?  She's a woman?  Now I get why Bill did it....
"It is more socially acceptable to be gay than to be white or male. Ultimately being a white male gets me accused of being racist by the BLM Pride Committee (with the tacit agreement of Tory, Wynne Trudeau and Wong Tam)  despite being gay and non malicious."
We have had easy access to  weapons for a century. Shootings like this are a new phenomena denying everyone what has been our Constitutional right because we have crazy people and radical Muslims is a poor answer.
"You can stick a fork in the roasted pig!  Pretty comical actually that it wasn't the Muslims, Mexicans or tax issues.  Just being himself.  Clinton should cancel the rest of her ads.  Save the dough, she's home free."

"Well there you have it. The Globe's most worthy apologist for this tarnished govt. Konrad, you should be ashamed of yourself for so heavily buying into the party line. Flanagan would have said the same, but perhaps with just a hint of 'mean' to it."
"The mainline Protestants ARE VALIDLY BAPTIZED!!!!! And they are recognized by the Catholic Church as Christians.  Furthermore, the Catholic Church, at Vatican II recognized that Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox comprise the Church, not just Catholics only.  Lumen Gentium, 14."
"No, it wouldn't. Again, he didn't want to bake a cake for a gay wedding. The issue wasn't serving them at all."
Terrorism Is a real threat … but try to keep in mind only a small percentage of terrorist attacks carried out on U.S. soil over the last couple decades where carried out by muslims. Lesser yet Somalians muslims.
In a way to be concerned about your safety yes. To be left wing quite often is to champion those who would want to kill you.
"“Ivanka Trump calls for tolerance following threats on Jewish centres” ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I wonder if she realizes the irony and the hypocrisy in her call. Her father stoked the fires of racial and religious intolerance and filled his cabinet with like-minded bigots, but she remained silent until it impacted her own religion."
You're full of it Quibly. I travel a lot and people have nothing but good things to say about Canada.
"That is how early Christians destroyed the ancient Roman civilization,: by smashing one statue at a time."
Don't confuse the US with 'English speaking nations'. The use of f----t to mean male homosexual was basically unknown in the UK and Ireland until the last decade. It is a US import - seemingly the same in New Zealand where I am now.
There aren't Nazi's silly. Certainly not ones making bomb threats to Jews. The fact you think that demonstrates your susceptibility to propaganda.
"We pedestrians should start making citizens' arrests of all cyclists who ride on sidewalks and hold them in place until the police arrives. This way, everybody will be safer and happier."
"Lorna, what is your take on the story of the great deluge? In that scenario god euthanized most of the human race for being 'sinful'. Whether you consider it literal or allegorical it doesn't say much for the sanctity of human life by your creator."

I agree......Jesus had cigars and bourbon with jazz playing for the social hour after the last supper......how quickly some folks forget.
"I'm with you, Mike.  But I would use the terms: same sex 'behavior' or 'homosexual behavior.'  The other words (sodomy or sodomites) sound caustic to modern ears."

That only works when vermin like Muslims aren't involved in the mix.
"One thing you have to understand is that RD's actual knowledge of transgendered people is nil. His knowledge of feelings is also nil, so he has decided that they count for nothing."
"What utter, hyperbolic rubbish. As if Obama carefully plotted this to outrage the Jewish faith."
"... but no one wants one Jewish state with disaffected, disenfranchised Palestine...'  Unfortunately, that is precisely what the Israeli right wing want (assuming they can't get rid of the Palestinians altogether)."
"That's like saying a racist doesn't hate black people, he just hates the color of their skin. Or an anti-Semite doesn't hate Jews, he just hates their religion. Or a misogynist doesn't hate women, he just hates their gender."
4) Hinduism worships gods that are not the God of the Bible.  Why should money spent on a Catholic school facilitate paganism/polytheism? My Catholic university spent money to buy idols for their worship services.
Don't bother.  Rio rarely posts except on any jewish or Israel related story. He clearly has an agenda. Don't feed the troll.

The Muslim religious culture is so far from our Canadian values that it is impossible for most Canadians to believe that our supposed multicultural society can ever accept their religious culture. The solution is obviously that we should very much limit the number of Muslim immigrants.

Boots and I are waLKING all over the beaten Trump.  The truth is the terrorists are already here and they aren't Muslims.  Checks the stats guys and wake up!
Actually it calls for the death of all Jews in the world.
"Only the informed globe drive writers can show us a picture of a heavy duty 2500 truck then go on to describe a 1500 with a V6 engine. Globe writers should go back to writing what they know best about, like transgender people and their washroom problems."
Precocious doesn't mean what you think it does. Look it up.
Obama has defecated on Israel repeatedly.  Why would any Jew give him the time of day?  Iran has pledged to wipe Israel off the map and Obama gave them the means to do it.... nukes.
I though gay marriage was going to control population growth.  I guess I was wrong.
"And a boot smashing a human face, forever."
I agree. Stay out of it. Russia and Muslims (of all stripes) were fighting Wayy before Bush thought he was king. They have lots of crap going on that North America and even the UK won't understand.
"Israel and AIPAC OWNS our congress, as evidenced by the 30 standing ovations netanyahu got.  Yet these jewish left wingnuts in the fec are 'horrified' by a russian vodka ad on drudge.  This is total friggin clown world here."
I would not vote for you as that would be a vote against the country and our cherished belief system!  Now go to your transgender room and close the yap!
I would like to see a program that tried to integrate armed forces personal into the fire department. 6 months working with the fire department would seem like a vacation for Canada's true heroes.
Steve Jobs wasn't eleven years old! This is about the rights of children...
"Honestly I am dumb struck. Of all the issues facing the Church, this is the one a Bishop concentrates himself with?  Most days I'm proud to be Catholic. After reading this I can safely say that today is not one of those days.   Fr. Neil Pezzulo"
Shouldn't the title read 'Muslim extremist wrecks havoc on innocent students'?
This must be what Harper's minions on the back bench do to stay awake.
"So much ignorance in 9 little words, kmedland1. That 'girl' has 'M' on his  birth certificate.  You seem utterly unaware about trans folk.  Google 'Buck Angel' and tell me she belongs in the 'women's room'.  Good Christ - this is the kind of ignorance we have to put up with."
"If only they will stop crying and exaggerating every small incident!!!!!!! I read this news article the other day about Quebec Muslims crying that they have never felt this unsafe before, yea right, maybe you should move back to where you came from if you find this unsafe!"
You're confusing 'cajones' with racism.  White Neo-Nazis chanting 'Jews will not replace us' are 'very fine people.'  Black athletes quietly kneeling are 'sons of bitches.'  Rote patriotism is not an ideal of this country.
Konrad isn't going to get an invitation to the inauguration of anyone even if it's held in Wilno or Barry's Bay!
remember 'wacky' should be the rallying cry against trumpkins and westelca.
I guess you think that baseball enjoyment is more important than social justice.
Funny how these brave feminists have no problem with how islam treats women?  Only Trump is the bad guy!
"You assume that mist lesbian or gay male couples yearn for recognition and blessing by the leadership of this sect. Those I know, me and mine included, do not."
Obama and Trudeau think transgender washrooms are YUGE important matters of state
"By the same token, Catholic students should not have to pay for atheist an other non-faith based schools. Why do I have to pay for heathens and infidels to receive state based filth?"
"...she rolls out aseries of her so called attacks on faith....none of which attack Jesus, or Mohamed or Budda etc .... the pope's the church, aand her aunt....that's not attacking faith"
"Jews won't replace them. Instead, these losers will be ignored, cast aside, forgotten. They're whining because whites have 70% of the power, instead of 90%."
The cognitive dissonance is amazing. Mitch McConnell extends the Senate session determined to pass a so-called health care bill depriving millions of access and Christians cheer? What?
"If we could only listen to each other respectfully without getting each others backs up, progress could be made in solving difficult challenges facing this country. True collaboration."
"The question IS about baking a cake.  Please read: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/16/us/supreme-court-baker-same-sex-marriage.html.  'Mr. Phillips shut down the conversation as soon as he heard that a gay couple was getting married.  “I’ll make you birthday cakes, shower cakes, cookies, brownies,” Mr. Phillips recalled saying. “I just can’t make a cake for a same-sex wedding.”"
Thank you for the great Christmas cheer.
I wonder if the Jews thought that as they were being prodded into rail cars by men with guns..?
"Good article. Gay marriage was also about portraying gay men as monogamous seeking individuals, rather than the reality of promiscuity and HIV infection that still exists in the community."
why then funding them partly is ok?? is that make it only half wrong or half right? it is either right or wrong. make your mind up.
You actually read that rant?
tea Party'--a scattered group of American patriots who believe in fair taxation and smaller Gov't.--what is it you people don't get.
This has all been a great exercise in how to whip up a crisis where none exists.
"Islam is no more deserving of respect than any other idea or philosophy. People deserve respect. Islam, like other religions, is tribal and destructive. I will not be silenced in my criticism of these archaic and barbaric ideologies."
"Merkel is neither intelligent nor knowledgeable.  She is a puppet of Islamists, supporter of gay-rights oppressors in Riyadh, and does not know that Obama bugged her phone (though the whole world knows it)"
"Only in America. Society, rules, laws, boundaries are torn down, thrown out, tossed aside, and discarded as being outdated, unfair, anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-anything."
The problem with all this is that Trudeau and his government are dealing with someone who is probably mentally unstable. Witness Trump's rant against the judge who overturned his travel ban against Muslims.  Maybe the best accompaniment for Trudeau will be men in white coats.
I think the percentage of Canadians he is offensive to is higher than your estimate. Even white males like myself are offended by this man.
"I disagree with you about the nature of transgender people, but ...  Welcome aboard!"
"if this terrorist problem isn't solved peacefully now , that is ,  by muslims, then it will be solved violently by other later"
Beware the Gay Mafia.  They are the BIGGEST group of self-centered hypocrites & thugs on the planet.
Not all transgender people have gender reassignment surgery.
"I remember that period as well. Since everyone in my father's family was Anglican, and my mother's family were all Jews, it seems they were all damned."
"According to Trump voters, this interstate compact agreement is a no-no. Think Aurora theater shooter and the Muslim sex offender named as a suspect in Clement's murder. Of course, the rules and law (rule of law) only matter when it favors their agenda."
You do realize that Jews read the bible too don't you?  Just the Old Testament part.  It's so funny that people are so obtuse about this fact.
Interesting.  But since no one has ever  been fined for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.  I can't see how it wouldn't be.
"I thought Jesus is dead.  Oh yeah-- I forgot he got resurrected and has been hiding out ever since, but a lot of you seem to know what he's thinking and feeling -- how convenient for you and self-serving."
I support religious liberty AND Thomas Jefferson's great wall of separation between church and state. No religion should trump equality under the law. Period. Good fences make good neighbors. Why does fundamentalism target gays rather than ALL persons who violate biblical morality like divorce and living together etc.?
"That power argument is a big joke, applicable only when the victims are pre-pubescent.  This is about homosexual sex acts and the preference for younger, near-pubescent age men/boys.  Married men without same-sex attraction, no more altar girls, and a lot would be resolved."
"Playing the victim card once again, what's new?"
Fortunately you are not a Christian.  Otherwise you would need to care about your fellow man (or woman).
I bet if she was a Nun you would have more respect.
"Admiral Zukunft says 'I will not break faith' with transgendered members of the Coast Guard, but apparently has no problem disobeying the President of the United States. He should be removed from his command forthwith."
"Now that is a load, it has been Obama and Kerry in full out attack on Israel,   Trump is Jewish you fool"
"Mel, The world is swinging left, baby. Heeeyeahhhhhawwww!!!!! First we take Ottawa then we take Moscow!!! Power to the people!!!! The people united will never be defeated!!!!!!!!!!!! Hoooo Hawwww!!!!!"
"A Catholic Women's Strike is one of my dreams.  I would envision all the women, nationwide, refusing to do any work of any kind for the church, including attend Mass, starting on a Thursday and ending on a Monday morning.  Pick a date, I'm in."
"The true fascists are those who seek to silence any open scientific debate surrounding transgender issues. As it stands now, qualified professionals asking too many questions risk their livelihoods and reputations by questioning the politically correct wisdom surrounding the issue now"
"That murderous sociopath who claim to be religious are killing people.  Christians meanwhile profited from enslaving millions of Africans over hundreds of hears, occupied these nations then propped up dictators in the war against communism"
This is not a justification'  Really?  If an entire city taken over by Daesh affiliated terrorists raising the filthy Daesh flag over churches while taking priests and Christians hostage isn't then what is?
"If there was anything to reinforce the perception of the Catholic Church as a fetus-fetishism cult, this would be it.  Just ghastly."
Mom you are a hero and I applaud you. I also wish all the best for your son and we are so blessed having people like you in this world. Definite prayer for you and your son at church this Sunday!
"There are probably valid moral arguments about banning transgendered persons from serving in the military.  This is not one of them, and reeks of adolescent moral reasoning. I'm surprised the Denver Post chose to publish it."
Wow. a few months ago you were a stalwart defender of women when you feared transgendered people in the restrooms.   Now you wholeheartedly support a guy who brags about sexual assault.  Strange guy.
Blowing ISIS off the face of the earth might be their worst fear. our tolerance and some Liberalism just make them hate us more.
the jews fleeing the nazis.....where deniend the right to come to the usa.....becouse thay where from germeny....and the usa said that thay mite be nazis.....
I hear you Canada1. I don't want a Leader. I want representation.
Married men with children are less likely to be the molesters of boys that homosexual priests have turned out to be.'  Absolutely not true.  Look up the statistics. I'm not doing it for you.
What is there to hurray for? Pulling out of the Paris Agreement? Trying to take away health insurance of 20 million Americans? Banning transgender people from serving in the military?
The Right: Always more than willing to be dishonest!!!
"Quick, name a better Central Banker.....let me see most cons always admired Greenspan, the Aynn Rand groupie.....but surely you see what a joke he was now....so name a better one?"
"w kingIf you cannot comprehend international law, why not just start thinking about basic human respect for other human beings?"
"I can say 'Orthodox Jews'  I can also say Sharia law, burka, honor killings, Assad soldiers raping women, Isis raping women"
"No, it is largely the institutional Church showing a lack of compassion for gays."
It's just really hard to find an Indigenous Asian Female who's transgendered lol
"And here is another progressive Catholic who's against free speech, and ignores the recent murders of innocent Christians in Egypt and elsewhere.  It's so strange."
I hope the cake guy wins.  The gays and their drama...
"ummmm no  To find the hate for homosexuals, minorities ( infidels), women you need to visit a mosque.  Merry Christmas"
"National Catholic Reporter is the best newspaper in the country, Catholic or secular.  It deserves the support of all of us."
"When wrong is committed in the world, it is right to sanction it. As a Christian, I say it is high time that Christians stop defining themselves by what happens in the bed. It is time to define ourselves by our generosity to all of our fellow man."
A quick google shows many examples to contradict you. 'Black Lives Matter blindsides Jewish supporters with anti-Israel platform' 'BLM activist advocates white genocide at Harvard - YouTube' ...
AS BAD AS THAT IS IT IS BETTER THAN HALF BREED MUSLIMS!
A Trans man is a man that wishes he was a woman. Grasp the concept
"....sharing of the blog post and discussion on her show led to 'Islamophobia and hatred toward Muslim people.'  I think 9-11 had a lot to do with that, not sharing a blog."
"Is the cosmic Jewish zombie baby snow white, or did they bother to find a doll with some color?"
"Love drama, but the kind done by professionals not your crybaby antics"
The Muslim youth unemployment situation has more  influence  on radicalization than devotion to Islam.
"We're being told there are no differences-it's how you 'identify'. Fine by me. When will the US Olympic team be allowing transgender women sprinters? No big deal, right?"
You will absolutely love the women's rights perspective of those deluging Europe now. See Sweden the rape superpower with Germany catching up.
"Most intelligent statement to date on this subject, destroy the ideology and you destroy the movement. Muslims have done this before, they must do it again. Bombs do not work."
"Klastri, Muslim ban?  Why do you make up such stuff?  Where in the EO does is religion mentioned?"
"The policy of the church is that gays or straight clergy are to be celibate---no sex with anybody, even themselves."
"I remember the Conservatives raised not a peep when another popular PM spouse, Mila Mulroney, was provided with office and staff, yet they have done a 180 now. Hypocrisy? Nah.......Let's stop being so mean, small-minded and cheap"
"From a policy perspective, the endearing thing about Trump is his incompetence. Pence is sufficiently coherent that he could put in not just a Transgender ban, but a full LGBT ban."
The exclusion of 'outsiders' and emphasis on 'purity of the race' is very much a RIGHT wing trend. Just ask Hitler.
A classic counter terrorism operation. Deny the Moslem terrorists their support base.  Seems to be working as the terrorists have declared a truce while they re-organize their logistics.
The lady in the burqa at Canadian Tire also did it for Syria.  She lumped all white Christian in one basket and committed a hate crime. but she will get away with it.
Nothing like being gay and hanging in Gaza City town square.
"Is the G&M going to report on what certain Imams at this mosque were promoting? Death to Jews anyone?  Of course not, it doesn't flow with the narrative.  G&M: A newspaper with an agenda."
and so do many americans believe the same way.   Why NC can't even accept trans bathrooms.  Come on..............
It's really clerical homosexual pederasty that was/is the issue.   We see it flare up again with Milo and George Takei.  It existed with Oscar Wilde.   It was a HUGE problem in the last 50 years with homosexual priests.
"Yes, she always manages to find a way to explain outrages committed by Muslims  in a way that directly or obliquely blames the west.  Which warms the hearts of the moral equivalency crowd."
You mean the pussy grabber? How could you evangelical far right Taliban style Christians cast a vote for such con man? Explain that and then tell us again how LGTB pose a risk to your rights as a citizen.
"and therefore, you do not have the right to force your aberrations on others. should a christian butcher be forced to make a moslem sacrifice? NO. should a christian physician be forced to perform an abortion? NO. shameful."
Nice article by 3 Lesbiens
The military will refuse to follow Trump without the authorization of Congress. They've already refused to listen to him on the Transgender ban...
Trumptie duped the voters and once again they fell for it.  The Christian voters always get duped.  The Tea Baggers too.  He drained the swamp to make room for the jackals.
If you work with 4 Catholic priests you should be able to readily get a precise definition of the term 'Invincible Ignorance'.
"Cinnamon Hitler'? Yes, Trump is exactly like Hitler, what with his half Jewish grandkids and the millions of people he's sent to concentration camps and the world war that he started. Idiot."
So....Jewish kids should be blown up in their school...is that your point ?
And before Vatican II all the Latin American countries were 90%+ Catholic. Maybe the bishops should focus on why they are losing so many Catholic who are seeking to get their spiritual needs met elsewhere over material concerns?
"Yeah, and Breitbart is pro-Israel and run mostly by Jews.  Come on dude, spend more than 2 minutes at a site before you make an idiot of yourself."
Or a few drunk lesbians.
what good have the millions of fake Christians ever done for anyone?
Yes I'm sure doing mushrooms and eating berries requires massive intelligence.
"Oh, so you have no problem with you son looking at a man in a locker room and sizing him up, or your daughter looking at another woman, it's natural.   It's just trans-gendered people who bother you. Got it."
Of the 4 posters above I would lay money most are gay activist!
That's hysterical! The alt-right ARE the barbarians.
Transgendered bathrooms ? We pay for this madness ?
islam has had a terrible impact on the western world. Now there is someone in a position of power that recognizes the danger and is willing to do something about the spread of it in the US.
"Social and economic equality work amazingly well in social democracies like Norway, Denmark and Sweden."
"Much like the Pharisees who conspired, colluded and crucified Jesus Christ. 'Close-minded ideas.' Yes, you hit the rusty nail on the head."
"You speak for your wife, do you? I guess you white Christian men know how to keep them under control, no burkas required!"
The only status that matters is being a Canadian. Remove all other status designations and let us move on as one nation where everyone is treated equally.
"And Jesus said, 'Enough!  Put away your sword. Those who live by the sword, die by the sword.'"
I never would have guessed you were a closeted gay male based on that jacket you're wearing..or maybe this is just a really good disguise after all.
"Between apologizing for all generational misdeeds of the white man, meeting with Muslims in mosques and catering incessantly to LGBT, our man Trudeau seems to have a full agenda. Maybe in year two he'll make some time for the average Canadian who has bills and taxes to pay."
"Inshallah,  it is God's will.  At least that what they say when they blow up Christians."
"How about a pm who tells the truth, shows respect for parliament, does not put corporate profits ahead of everything else, and actually cares about Canada. We don't have that at the moment."
"The only troll is Amira herself, trolling for Islam and for western civilization's submission to the Koran. Her hijab is the sign she handed her fate to Allah. Giving up free will is just one thing Muslims ar expected to sacrifice for their religion.  5th posting"
Israel's military does not appear to have suffered by including transgender soldiers.
I'm starting to like this guy. Refreshing. Ford in 2014 !!!PS Ainslie is a goof.
Every sperm is sacred? The little whimpers of each sperm must make you cry
No one knew of homosexuality? ! Were you raised in a bubble?
I know this decision will hurt feelings but it is probably the right one. Until society in general comes to terms  with transgender disorder there will be too much drama playing out to have it effect national security.
"Von, But, you see, spirituality isn't religion. My idea of spirituality is quite the antithesis of religion. It's more about the shared reality of people in the here and now, not the unreality in the hereafter."
You're either utterly ignorant or totally incapable of telling the truth. Trump's VP is viciously antigay...  http://www.businessinsider.com/mike-pences-most-controversial-stances-on-gay-rights-abortion-and-smoking-2016-11  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/04/mike-pence-led-anti-lgbt-backlash-trump
You dont see the difference between being concerned about immigration and wanting  it slowed or stopped and calling for the death of of Jews and Blacks? You must be blind.
"AUGUST IS PERSECUTE A CHRISTIAN MONTH IN THE USA,THE SOUTHERN BAPTISTS DESERVE PERSECUTING THE MOST FOLLOWED BY THE MORMON FREAKS"
"It is interesting to note that Womens Netball is quite regularly seen at primetime, live on New Zealand television. Further, both men and women are supportive of rugby teams of both genders."
I would rather share a bathroom with a transgendered person than a sanctimonious bigot.
"Huh, maybe that's why lesbian sex is shown in straight porn and not considered homosexual porn.'  And you know this how?"
People get the government they deserve'.
The first step on a long road to restoring democratic institutions and responsible government based on the rule of law and respect for the governed comes on October 19th. Carthago delenda est!
"For all the liberal supporters that says she should get help, why not pay for every member of parliament spouse also? After all if their spouse is doing something for them, why shouldnt they receive money also? Or is it just for SGT?"
"Well, Clearthinker. I wasn't aware that gays can force people to give them baked goods for free..."
You've just called the innocent Canadians he murdered Islamic terrorists.  No surprise.
"The world must stand United in fighting all forms of Trumpism which leads to Islamphobia, racism, anti-semitism and disgracing the transgender community."
"Burly123: Mr Birch hates Chinese, Muslims and Black Canadians too."
Are you changing your lifestyle so it is not reliant on petroleum products or are you like Leonardo Decaprio and will continue to preach about the evils of the oil industry while you drive your car by your self 1 hour each way to work
Hawaii Dems proposed the resolution.  So let them take the complaints when the Con-Con results in a Constitution that outlaws gay marriage and abortion.
"Funny how the author uses Jews in this column, but he is rabidly anti-Israel and pro-flooding of Europe with Middle East migrants.  This is so transparent. His fake sympathy to Jews is sickening."
We must be submissive Marian broodmares for Jesus.  Duh.
Watch this video and weep http://canadians.org/energyeast
They certainly weren't invited by the Chinese government. They were invited by House Christians as opposed to state-sanctioned Christianity.
"Canada is a cesspool, used to be the nicest country on earth, now it is a cesspool of 3rd world immigrants and parasite politicians that have sold Canadians out to keep power. This place is SH."
"Sadly, it is the sanctioning of bullying OF homosexuals that comes about as the result of how the Church deals with homosexuality - another reason gay teens suicide."
Support for Donald Trump in Canada is strongest in Alberta. Go figure!
"You left out one trait, they are also Jewish.  But if she had said older, white Jewish men, oh the outrage."
Especially those that are lesbian phobic and dead from the neck up.
"So is Jason Kenney. No one today thinks that being gay and conservative are mutually exclusive persuasions, nor they should be."
"Frankly I hope that it changes Britain for the better, and we make sure the Muslims know that if thye want to live amongst us.. they better stop this nonsense, or a lot of them are going to suffer real pain."
"Good question. I am sure the answer is not because Christianity is better than Islam. I think the answer has more to do with politics, economics etc."
"No one should ever trust a Catholic priest or bishop after what they have done to so many innocent little boys. No parent should ever let their children alone with one.  As for this lawsuit, it sure sounds fishy as 'ICEEBEAR' so succinctly put it."
And we still have plenty of people who want to see more Muslims here.  Sickening...
"If you watch the latest John Oliver video you'll see Ms. LePen at her very best, spouting anti-Semitic threats of tossing a few more Jews into the ovens, etc. She's a thoroughly disgusting person."
"that example is retard tier regardless, even you should get it straight away"
You don't know any Catholic heterosexual males who like classical music?  More's the pity.
"I tried to reply to you, but it seems citing published peer-reviewed studies on rates of Personality Disorders  among patients who also identified as trans is considered offensive.  ....which kind of goes to proving my point, that this legislation will be weaponized by high-conflict individuals suffering from personality disorders."
What am I missing here? The Chinese government going after Falun Gong ain't no difference than the US government building a Mexican wall and keeping out Muslims.  It's all a gong show seems to me.
Plenty of difference. Palestinians stab innocent Jews in Israel who are going about their day-to-day lives.
Try marching down to a stripclub respectful places and everyone has a price what's yours? Just cause someone is different then you doesn't mean protest it. I didn't protest that Obama couldn't say Muslim terrorist even though every time it was just that.
Maybe better than lying and cheating
"Have you ever tried to get into a University with the same GPA as a black, gay, woman with a limp?"
same as gay marraige ........ cowardly unprincipled politicians scared off by a small vocal group who want to impose their unfair peticular religious dogma onto others...throwing the common sense of my 91 year old WWII vet dad out the window.  Cowards!
I have no issues with these types of individuals. However it is unfair to the genders that were born female. This transgender may be a female now in physical appearance but still maintains the strength of a male through
"Ran gas chambers?  You're defending a mob including organized Nazis who were yelling anti Jewish slogans at their rally.  Darn right people like that used to run gas chambers, so why are you defending them?"
I'm a white Evangelical Christian. I proudly cling to my Bible and my guns. I am a member of the NRA. I am a proud American.  I am your worst nightmare. And there are about 100 million of us.
That quote does not imply morality originates from Christianity. And the West's morality is dominated by Christian morality. Are you going to deny history? Our past is overwhelming Christian.
"Huge scandal'?   That would be the hundreds of gay priests who molested children.  That was a huge scandal the church may never fully recover from. The burial of gay parishioners isn't something that most people care about, so it  hardly rates as a scandal."
Pay the firefighters by the call. Only when they are doing the job. Not while they are waiting for the 'work' to show up.
The islamic kingdom asked for more cupholders and a backup cam next year
Just the Kid can not protest against a Muslim leader.  That will be Islamophobia.  Hahaha.
"You miss the entire point of the article and seem to want to besmirch any female leader you believe is on the left. Yours is a political, anti-female leader rant."
"Yeah, the very one's that like to practice sodomy in the privacy of their bedroom but deny it to gay couples.  Tee hee."
I find it near impossible that a true Christian could be a republican.  Republicans have abandoned their values and are today frauds.  I am talking the national level.  I think there are a few good republicans in Hawaii.
Yeah let's focus on Shumuer. Let's FORGET that Donny is the most incompetent president in US history...
"You have to admit that the blacks have had it harder than the Irish, Jews, Ukrainians, etc. You see, if any of the above changed their names, you couldn't tell they were different. A black person can't change his name and look like a white person."
"The 1% in this country are largely liberal Democrats.  Most of them are liberal Jews and liberal WASPS.  Watch FoxNews sometime, you'll learn new things !"
Next year he can book passage on the Sliverseas cruise ship as it does a Northwest Passage cruise and save taxpayers money.
"Isn't that we they thought in 2008 and 2011. Some seem to think they are still the natural governing party. The Tories are not the natural governing party, but neither are the Liberals."
I wonder how the hermaphrodites feel about this? Seems the tranny community is getting all the ink.
Russia as a whole is hostile to homosexuals.
Clueless! I see you still are!
"Muslims were here before cars and airplanes. Again, it's somebody writing in asking a question. What does SJW have to do with it?   We should all be concerned about border officers targeting/harassing people for no reason."
"Not to worry.  Obama is importing millions of Muslims to replace the Mexicans.    Mr Trump, build that wall."
1 in 3 billion?  were the 2 Boston Marathon bombers 1 in 3 billion?  was the Florida gay nightclub 1 in 3 billion ?  was 9/11  1 in 3 billion ?
You and your ilk should be duly processed and charged with promotion of Hate against Jewish people!
She swears she wasn’t doing it when we were together and it was only pills that she was doing when I kicked her out the last time plus I haven’t fucked her in 2 1/2 years but I still feel like I should get tested for every disease known to man.
The military is being abused........by the freaks that the 'Hoodrat' let in.......transgender freaks of nature.
"Whatever the reasons, they are still dumb. Don't want to show your face?don't become a citizen."
Were you quivering in your perma-virgin rage as you typed that out?
Never thought I would ever agree with Mr. Simpson on anything. I do on this however. A very good description of what's wrong.
"Thousands of transgender members are CURRENTLY serving. And, in a tweet, Trump just ordered all of them to be thrown out."
"Oh sure Ben, it was just about opportunity, because these priests were on an island where there were no females.  Is it really true that gay people think heterosexual men are attracted to boys?  What a strange idea."
"This is among one of the most ridiculous lies spoken to date: ' discriminates against homosexuals '.  From the 2016 GOP convention speakers: Mr. Thiel : 'I am proud to be gay, republican and American' Mr. Trump: 'I will protect our LGBT citizen's from hateful foreign ideology'.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSVLpzGseXw"
Only problem is we now have two little dictators and one will feed the other's narcissistic needs.   Trump's daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism so it will be next to impossible for him to be remotely impartial in this dispute.   This will not end well.
You declare that homosexual acts are immoral and evil.  I declare that you are evil for trying to devastate a group of people just for being who they are.  So whose declaration should carry greater weight?
"I support your cause 100%!But at the same time, I support political and economic autonomy for aboriginal nations. I think Canada running the lives of aboriginals is completely wrong."
"Women and children first. Helping those who are most vulnerable first isn't discrimination, it's the right way to do things."
At least we don't have to worry about transgender hottie hottie issues on an airplane today.
"Those stories about gay sex orgies aren't welcome at NCR.  NCR delights in blaming the Church for what gay priests do, and when referencing stories of abuse, adheres to a policy of gender agnosticism re the victims of these priests.   That is, if these victims are male."
"when speaking about people like the clintons, nasty is simply being kind"
"There will be civil war, too many people don't want to go along with this 3rd world genocide, there will be a war to separate and form normal nations like we used to be, not these 3rd world cesspools that are being forced on us now."
"What's any of that have to do with this story about Trump's guy who's a wife beater, hates Jews, and may have committed election fraud? (Remember when Republicans used to care about election fraud? lol)"
Trump says this is not a Muslim ban. He lies about his motives.
"The women came out because he is a hypocrite, a child predator.  Comeon trumpers,  defend the child predator Christian, lol"
"Only the GOP extremists believe in God -- what a ridiculous comment. Seems the right-wing extremists wouldn't vote for Christ Himself, calling Him too socialist."
Hundreds of thousands of Hawaiians who are Christian know that stones are not sacred.  Christ is and Christ alone.  Stop making the ignorant bow to strones while the rest of you go about your regualr business.
dershowitz is a loud mouthed hook nosed jew scum who is loyal to israheil.  we can only hope that the brain cancer spreads quickly.
Compassion is for the person who does the wrong...' 'A person who does a criminal unjust act needs to be forgiven.' 'The adult people who have been molested need to offer forgiveness as well.'  Here we have another conservative Catholic that believes in compassion and forgiveness for pedophile priests.
"Liberal bigotry against the Jewish began a long time ago.  Out damned spot, out."
"The issue is why people feel the need to be able to detect gay people.  Over the years, many have claimed to have come up with ways to do this.  Why?  So people can discriminate against them?"
"Obama apologised in Cairo, was snubbed by Kenyan President for his gay agenda, was downgraded to a backdoor welcome in China, and was called 'Son of a W----' by president of Philippine. That speaks about his spine (or lack thereof)."
"Sigh.  Yes, DB-TA, protecting unpopular citizens like muslims from a government decision - in this case government decision by referendum.  That's exactly the kind of thing that Constitutions do, in Canada and elsewhere."
"You're missing the point. Pastors,  Bakers and photographers don't want to do your gay wedding. That's their choice. Go somewhere else that WILL.   I'm perplexed why gay people would want to support a business that doesn't even support their gayness anyway lmao"
Time to ban Islam from all western countries.
The 'citizens united' supreme court decision is a large part of the escalating $$$ involved in American elections
"I generally avoid engaging Odinsson Underbridge, or even directly reading his nonsense. However, you bring up a relevant point. Yes, there are indeed racist POC, antisemitic Jews, and even gender role intolerant GLBTQ. They are not a contradiction."
"...he had a prayer rug at work and took regular breaks for muslim prayers....'  That just means he discovered the hard way there's 10 different factions of Islam ,and they all hate and want to kill each other.  Assuming your statement is true , that is."
These are the Nazis of the Muslim world.  Like the Nazis they have destroyed  historical sites and statues representing views opposite of their own. Like the Nazis they indiscriminately kill those who they consider to be sub-human.  My condolences to the Spanish people.
"Certainly a lot more then Trump is. Think about this, OUR Government has destroyed our country MUCH more then Islam could ever dream of doing. Think about it."
"Israel: democracy for Jewish Israelis, discrimination ad second-class citizenship for Israeli Palestinians, and apartheid for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. That is what is supporters defend."
Will you stop trying to put people into neat little boxes that fit your preconceptions? I am staunchly Conservative. I support the right to abortion.
Nonsense. You have any evidence for this claim or is it a religious belief on your part?
"That is one of the differences between D’s And R’s.  R’s celebrate sexual assault with their orange messiah.  D’s cast aside the sexual predators.  Very Christian, the sexual assault that is"
"Today in France, the Jews no longer have to fear the Nazis. They are being attacked by the adherents of another ideology that is just as odious and violent - one based on the teachings of a Seventh Century pedophile."
"Oh yeah, you gotta watch out for those cut throat Christian suicide bombers."
"Thank you for the nugget from Breitbart. This is not an accurate rendering of the British Medical Association's guideline, which merely acknowledges that most people who get pregnant are obviously women but through language choice 'we can' include other people who may get pregnant (intersex or transgendered people)."
I identify as  transgendered ladybug sandpaper. your opinion is hate speech to my gender fluid.
"The article states 'trans gender Individuals,' which implies inclusivity for anyone who identifies as trans gender."
"In all the times I've used public bathrooms, I've never been concerned nor saw a transgender using the women's bathroom.  I'm far more afraid of someone leaving their body fluid or poop on the toilet seat than I'm worried about someone's gender."
"Pan, When Jesus was on earth, he was a dark skinned middle easterner not a ‘white’ European, i.e. he would be considered a ‘minority’ by current general standard.  So what are you going to answer when Jesus ask you 'Pan, Pan, why do you persecute Me?”"
Everyone knows that the rich are hurting and need our financial assistance. 
But I bet you're equally against increased immigration.
These are simply forms of progressive Catholicism of a non-white culture.   Who are we to judge?

"ridiculous, but it's OK to let and encourage 'children' about transgender......"
They have another choice. They could leave Islam and religion altogether or convert to another faith.
Not really. Perhaps you might ask Jesus or Buddha or Krishna or Mohammad.
"This will, of course, be used to try to shout down anybody who questions the number of Muslim immigrants and refugees that are let into the country."
"I don't agree that they drive American was, but I do believe they are the source of a lot of trouble in this country.  most jews are crazy liberals and are constantly trying to be in control to achieve this."

In what universe is a wild bear 'cute and cuddly' And that's just the beginning of problems with your analysis.
FAKE news.  There's no such thing as a transgendered person who can live a good life and serve productively.  These are not real people!    /s
Thousands upon thousands of men and women out of work and she wants those unemployed to vote for her ????? What kind of job does she have for them???
Many parents are blinded by faith and these are the ones you have to be aware of. Parents that find out their kids are gay and then try and convert them or in some cases beat them.
"Yep, 15 Russians on Facebook were able to counter the 24/7 bash Trump media that included CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, and MSNBC."
"Ummm, your Christianity has a bloody history as well. Any fear-based group is capable of violence -- be it by strapping a bomb to yourself or by voting for someone to do your bombing for you."
How do you feel about Obama pardoning a transgender traitor that cost taxpayers thousands of dollars for a sex change operation.  Knowing you probably pretty good.
"Come on Kenney, quit attacking everything Trans and admit who you really are.  Albertans won't judge you too harshly."
Israeli press suppression behaviour should be publically denounced by all Jews. Israeli right-wing nationalist are now operating as the Fascist of old.
Would the transgendered adult male who now identifies as a prepubescent girl suffer from a psychological disorder in your opinion?
Eid holidays will be coming soon and Easter will be gone.  The collateral damage will be on women and homosexuals.
I think a narrow government role is what we're getting now. Doesn't seem to be working.
"Married man here, not a priest.  Simple question though: who do you think Jesus would say has fuller participation in His Church?  The power hungry cleric or the ignorant farmer receiving Communion?"
How does Miller justify this sudden conversion to 'libertarianism' with his 'I'm the Christianest Christian that ever Christianed'?  The guy is a huge. swallowing hypocrite.
Ridiculous. Tax bracket information is available to everyone.
"May I ask what Viagra has to do with the Trans situation? And since you are talking about Viagra and costs, how much is spent on each trans person vs how much is spent on viagra per person?"
I can't wait to read the Globe's torturous reasoning when they come to endorse Harper et al. at the next election.
Catholic pedophile priest is Judas Priest (judas iscariot) with lots of help from the Bishop.  There are million and millions of judas priests.
"Yes, they both identical... Christians stone women all the time, and those honor killings..., but the GOP covers it up. Just for you."
No doubt these gay Chechens will be bringing their wife and children just in case anyone they know sees them in Canada and threatens their family back home in Chechnya.
The bible convinces you that you don't have to go to Church.....  Really?  how?
"The audacity of claiming Clinton's campaign is running on insults from the team where all Mexicans are rapist, all Muslims are terrorist, et al is truly insulting."
"Christian, Jewish, islam are the death religions. You have to die to reach heaven."
Harper's promise of greater transparency in government was a bunch of baloney. Why should Canadians believe in anything he says now.
I believe that the man was mentally incapacitated when he wrote his 1986 letter to the catholic bishops on the pastoral care [sic] of homosexual persons.
"So we don't need drunk driving laws, speed limits, public health care, trade laws, minimum wage laws, etc? Think your theories through a little bit next time, buddy."
"What is a trans woman is that man, I am confused."
"jesus, you are taking this very hard"
"Isn't that amazing? The cognitive dissonance of his followers is stunning.  The guy's a huckster, non-Christian, corporatist, trust-fund brat (everything they claim to dislike) who has NOTHING in common with his followers but they love him."
Most of the people trying to kill me thought they were just white Christians doing God's will. The KKK is a Christian organization.
"I wonder if they would turn away the help of gay paramedics, ambulance drivers, E.R. staff, or fire fighters."
"How does allowing gays to marry affect straight marriages?  And you don't have to remind us that your knowledge of communism is nil. We already were quite aware. Incidentally, how does the 'traditional family' protect from 'tyranny and Communism'?"

"Ban transgender military personnel willing and able to serve,  …promote those who commit sexual assault.   (…not like sexual assault by drill sergeants is a new thing.)"
on the other hand his toupee has always been a loyal follower
Such a weak attempt at diversion. How about Mr. Phillips is bigoted towards gays? Dislikes gay people and gay couples? Uses his religion as a sword and shield against gay people?
Once again Mr Saunders has managed to deflect Islamic problems in the West by claiming that the far-right is a greater threat to European Jews.He probably also thinks that white supremacists elected Donald Trump and British Skinheads were responsible for the Brexit vote.
You are pretty ignorant of what's going on if you think this is about protecting white people.  See my other posts on this article citing why affirmative action is BAD for Asians and Jews.
"How do you know transgendered people are not using public restrooms now? Do you check their junk, when they walk in the door? These 'bathroom bills' are a solution in search of a problem."
Amen. Your decency shines through
"So, turns out the anti-gay bigot is a pervert and kiddie rapist.  Of course the GOP stands up for him.  Being a pervert is only bad if you're a democrat.  Its a bonus if you're a republican."
"I hope he'll gather his coalition of: birthers, evangelicals, white supremacists, conspiracy theorists, neo nazi's, commies, and some local tough guys, to go fight them."
Impeach Trump. He's a danger to the United States and all that it stands for.  Deprogram his deluded followers; they're as bad as the Germans who refused to see that millions of Jews were being killed right under their noses.
For liberals to use fear mongering and Islam bigotry to justify military procurement is just another sign of this governments loose relationship with ethics.
The Pulse nightclub shooter was motivated by Islam's traditional rage against homosexuals.  This I what you must come to grips with.
"If you do not respect Canada as a constitutional monarchy, Do not become a Canadian."
"Some of Ezra's supporters have asked for an example of his hate.  Google his article about the Roma Gypsy's.  If you don't think it's racist, then replace Gypsy with Jew and tell me what you really think.  It's a great exercise in exposing hypocrisy."
Florence is to gay males what Yachats is to lesbians.  Surely you know that.
"wrong, you are typical of the problem in canada, this is not a federal responsibility , we dont need more government"
"FormerDougCo, Is the baker asking the gay couple for a cake? How are gay people discriminating against religious conservatives. If your religion says you are to kill me, but I kill you first in self-defense, is my killing of you discrimination?"
Then that would be a question of evidence as to which was the real reason for the refusal.   Are you suggesting there have been cases of bakeries that refused to make gay wedding cakes because they reasonably feared the couple wouldn't pay the bill?
This does not represent the majority of liberals any more than using a gay slur represents the views of Trump supporters.
All the seniors with the 'good jobs' refuse to retire and so there is limited opportunity for those younger than them.
"Clearly it is heresy to suggest that the Church not have total control over people's sex lives, because Jesus very clearly said, 'Love God and let my Church control your sex life.'"
We obviously need to keep having the debate until people recognize the truth and the side that denies it.

Its what progs do. They love to fix that which isn't broken.
"They don't like ostentatious expressions of personal religious beliefs, especially of thousand-year-old homophobic, misogynist, anti-science dogma. That makes them more logical than insular."
As the wife of the prime minister she deserves help with their three small children and for the many organizations that ask for her help. She is not a shill for the Liberal party but represents all of us. I support giving her the help she deserves.
I hope those professors are just as vociferous in supporting those who are critical of islamic doctrine. Will they leap up to defend those falsely accused of being islamophobic?

Indeed. The Tories are playing fast and loose with the Charter these days. We especially need to protect the freedom of expression of those people whose views are considered offensive by many.
"You know in everyone's life there is grief, stress and anxiety, but most people have no choice but to keep going each day and there is no organization encouraging them to come forward and be taken care of."

"Hey Roach, Like yours, the Harper reputation will be like that of the Tea Party rednecks in the US who controlled him 100%."
"Why bother with this silly article; we already know how he will handle this. Can't understand why the bias media keep calling this a Muslim ban when 87% of them worldwide are not affected. Silly, stupid and disgusting."

"How so? None of us believe Tulsi's shift on gay marriage was genuine, so don't even go there. What else?"
What a hypocritical editorial!
What garbage.  She isn't a girl. It will be interesting when teen age boys declare themselves transgender so they can explore the bodies in the girls locker room.  We can at least drop sex ed classes from schools now
Human rights 'advancing' is precisely why we have most of the problems we have today. Everybody has a right to have the gov take care of them while taking no reposibility for themselves. It is quite ridiculous.
J'accuse !  Witch! Counter revolutionary! Jew! Appropriator!
"Butinski, here is another theory.  The person at the helm was a transgender who was distracted while putting on his make up."
Then why don't you seek SOCIAL JUSTICE from the private sector employers who have sacrificed their workers' benefits while the corporate executives retain theirs and rake in ever increasing salaries and bonuses?
Hey the voter should know eh what are the Lieberals hiding about him ?
Easy:  1) They won't allow female elders (church leaders responsible for decisions) 2) They condemn co-habitation AND marriage between homosexuals. Can't get much plainer than that!
"Did this commission include black trangendered womxn, Black non-binary persons and black intersex bodies? Or did this commission exclude this marginalised and oppresssed group from these particular sex and gender conversations and policies?"
"The defence claimed self-defence, not stand-your-ground."
"Not the same as being gay, just having alter boys more at hand. Hopefully the modern number is small enough that the sample is small too. There are no reports of Vatican abuse, where the Lavender Mafia has its turf."
"Using the name of a historic figure from 1300 years ago noted for killing muslims and driving them out of Europe is pretty obvious, don't you think? One reason I use Alceste is irony, skyofblue. Are you concerned about it?"
You do remember what Paul Martin had to do in the 1990's remember? You realize he had to do that because of a massive mountain of debt built up over the years preceding him. Ridiculous to say that red ink doesn't matter.

Transgender people to not vote Republican in 2020
"Wow, that Goldy is seriously racist.  It appears that Levant is a self-hating  Jew out to torment his brothers and sisters.  The Rebel is promoting hatred and division and Canada and should be investigated by the RCMP."
"Except that most of the Republican hierarchy have failed to serve their country in times of war....Bush, Cheney, Rove, Trump etc. And the American values you speak of are exclusive of white Christian right wing folk....a minority in this country today, and are the values of hatred and bigotry."
"No longer needing Jewish votes, Mr. Obama was free, finally, to punish the Jewish state in a way no previous President has done.  Can there by any doubt…any doubt whatsoever…regarding the real purpose of…the Iranian nuclear deal?!?"
The only way LGBT lives are 'hell' is due to the effect of the  blatant bigotry on the part of this 'Prince of the Sect.'
"Somebody should explain to President Trump that we defend our country with more than rifles and cannons. Our complex weapon systems now demand brains and training. On these requirements our transgender soldiers amply fit the bill. Indeed, more so."
"I hold the governing association responsible, not this transgender boy. He asked to wrestle with the boys and was denied. There is little question about the advantage he had over his female opponents by taking testosterone but, had he wrestled with boys, it would not have been an issue."
"So, let us assume that Milo has an excuse for his views on the gay love. I  wonder what's Bill Maher's or Samantha Bee's excuse for being crude and hateful?"
"Gays  are not imprisoned and flogged in Israel as in Gaza, Iran, Saudi Arabia etc.   Pride parades in Israel  None from Morocco across north africa to Pakistan"

"who knows, God may very well exist... I just don't think he's visited for quite a while"
Now maybe he will have to answer to his extremist views on women and gays.
You have demonstrated your ignorance of the Catechism.   Canon 915 certainly applied to Tim Kaine due to the fact abortion is intrinsically evil verses the issues of prudential judgement.  It's too bad there are uneducated Catholics like you and Bishop McElroy destroying this Church.

"Marginalizing people', that's a laugh. You're the one to marginalize gay people. You also label people all the time. So, since you don't like homophobe, 'gay hater' will have to do."
"One wonders how many of these French are Jewish, escaping the rising wave of Judenhass that has swept France. Regardless, the result is to the betterment of Canada and PQ. Bienvenue, et Santé!"
"If Trudeau's government pushes forward with this, and the items mentioned in the 'open government' article, I will have massive respect for him and the federal Liberals. That they are promising to do this is very, very encouraging."
Are you suggesting that when we meet a Muslim woman we should arrange to conduct our conversation on a telephone to get over the issue of not being able to see her face?
This shameless vote is probably the last episode of Obama's 'Arab Spring' - radicalization Muslims everywhere and replacing moderate Muslim regimes with militant extremists.
The purity of the blood eh? Where oh where have I heard that before?
"This is Liberal policy. Would Justin force all of his MPs to vote in favour? Would they have to be Pro-Euthanasia to even run for the Liberals? Would he accept any limitations at all, or would it be 'on demand' ?"
"It's not racial rights, it's legal rights in the treaties stemming from the Royal Proclamation of 1763. You might want to learn some of this nations history, JB0713, and accept your responsibility to observe the law."

"Bravo. Let tolerance, equity and freedom be our passwords, and let them trump fear and hatred."
In the U.K. the word used was 'sissy'. It described boys who were unusually timid. Nothing sexual was intended as no one knew about homosexuality.
exactly first is was 'Who am I to judge?' about gays  then later he does not want gay priests  all platitudes like Justin Trudeau
Transgenderism is a guaranteed way of getting some attention when a youngster gets none at home.
Oh those poor criminals just trying to get free stuff
"Yes let's have free votes for culture war issues such as SSM, abortion, gun rights, prostitution, church and state, corporate lobbying, pipelines, whatever. It's more democratic that way."
Most Americans Support Open Transgender Military Service
There is no such thing as secular values. Maybe that's why?
Please mind you bigotry. We arent doing the 'gay equality is bad because of my god derp derp' stuff here.

Stupid as saying all Christians are responsible for paving the middle east over the years when it has been mostly the US and Britain
IRT Boots - You my friend are factually wrong. There has never been a study that concluded any person with X&Y chromosomes did any better as a woman. In fact the leading pioneer in transgender research has stated emphatically; 'the change more often does long term harm.'
Spoken by an expert in 'brown lipstick'.
Ya where is the gender equality there??
Well it didn't take danepol too long to drag out that old canard - anti zionist = anti semitism! In fact I think Manjra is an equal opportunity phobe. His Islamophobia is positively shocking! And in Feinsteins casecase it is anti zionist=anti Semite=self hating non practising Jew!
"If the day comes when a LGBTQ  or Islamic university exists, and they forbid Christians from becoming students, unless they are silent about their faith, will the government be so interventionist? Will Christians even be allowed to attend?"

"If there's a bad choice available, Trump will make it! His latest pick of David Friedman as ambassador to Israel will most certainly not bring peace to the middle east. Does he want more Muslim extremists? Because that is how you get more Muslim extremists."

"Delusions, hallucinations, fairy tales, religion. Not one ounce of evidence for any of it. Why is belief in Thor, Ramses and Zeus scoffed at?Religion is the last bastion of the ignorant."
The headline makes it sound like it's the School Board promoting hate. Not cool. It should read 'Ontario School Board's support prompts anti-Muslim backlash.' The school board is not fueling this hate. The hate is coming from bigotry and racism.
Islam permits true believers to dissemble in order to protect their beliefs and faith.
"If you are openly gay, does that mean you are sexually active?  Because that would merit suspension all by itself."
The fundies' war on gay marriage is ironic. They ought to welcome any support for a declining institution.

"And Palestinian's are the UN's chosen people in their objective of eliminating Israel and eradicating Jews from the region. Personally, I prefer God."
I agree the law should. But adding gays to if won't do that. Elimination of the law will.

Trump cited no credible source indicating that transgendered troops are a detriment to the effectiveness of the U.S. military.  It appears he is making statements like this to solidify his homophobic core supporters.
Im offended at your homophobic thoughts- you know its ok for one guy to like another guy.... even though that guy might be transgender-
"As your post demonstrates, Civil Comments has disabled the civility filter for the folks who were complaining about too many Catholic posts. Along with adding blocking, that puts things more or less back where they were with Disqus."

"As long as he doesn't watch it, he can say: Still haven't actually seen video of the 'Jews will not replace us' thing. Sounds like an urban legend. Willful ignorance."

Rep. Hensarling will say it was gay people's fault.
Maybe Mary was bodily assumed into heaven because Jesus wanted to keep the Church from pawing at her bones?
What's your point - that this is normal and our climate is not changing? Wake up! The trend is clear based upon evidence. We are in a time of serious climate disruption with devastating consequences if we refuse to act to stop fossil emissions.
And just how would that ever be enforced with any confidence of integrity whatsoever! Your post is the perfect example of why our rights and freedoms are disappearing. You rationalize it for them (and for us). No thank you mog_man!
I suppose you're right. If it ends up being a Muslim who carried out the attack we can just call it muslim on muslim shooting. or Muslim Terrorist attack?

The usual sane analysis from Mr. Heinbecker.
"Can we say Islam is bad? Islam is threat to Canada? It's illegal to say such thing?   Can we discuss this topic:    if Muslim becomes majority in Canada, or even 20%, What kind of Canada will become?"
The suicide rate for homosexuals is 4x greater (CDC stat).  Use of psychoactive drugs high.  Gay in this sense is a huge misnomer.

"Sure, because such medieval nonsense has absolutely no bearing on having faith in Christ and following his teachings. Why dabble in this extra-biblical nonsense which, as we have seen, so easily lends itself to abuse, corruption and distraction?"
Protestants? Jews?
This must be the work of Satan.  They probably rejected Christianity as being a 'white man's religion'.
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI! - Hypocrisy is a greater crime than racism.
"Since my prostate surgery so do I, but I do it in the proper gender assigned bathroom unlike the mentally deficient phony group calling themselves 'trans people'. You are as you came into the World, and even assignment surgery does not change fact to fiction."
"A one legged, multilingual ,trans, first nations, marxist should be appointed."
I am sorry to hear that you were homophobic and hope you have overcome it. As a Catholic I am not and have never been homophobic so I have never had the need for such an examination.
"I am white. Not a single one of my rights is threatened by my Muslim or Chinese neighbours. On the other hand, I do feel threatened by ignorant people who see immigrants and people of colour as the enemy."
"her grandfather was a Nazi , or a Nazi collaborator and  clearly  a propagandist.  Basic fact .   Her  grandfather helped kill Jews in the millions  Has she ever admitted this  fact while attacking Russia today and defending Nazi collaborators in her own family ???"
"It's a simple fact that there is no mention of a sexual encounter in the report. It's a quick read, you should check it out. By your logic, is everyone who does not support her a homophobe? I am neither a lesbian nor a homophobe, nice attempted troll though."
"Nancy Pelosi is right. She is the top Democrat fundraiser so black, liberal and transgender Democrats should best shut up and stop complaining. It's her party and she is the boss."
I've already popped the pop corn. How will Francis deal with this magna cappa pirate. (There is gay humor lurking in this analogy somewhere!)
"Here are Kristin Beck's (a transgender ex Navy SEAL) own words to Trump:  ''Let's meet face to face and you tell me I'm not worthy,' Kristin Beck, a 20-year veteran of the Navy SEALs, told Business Insider on Wednesday. 'Transgender doesn't matter. Do your service.'  http://www.businessinsider.com/kristin-beck-trump-transgender-ban-2017-7"
These warlock Dems did not deny Catholics when president Kennedy won they just killed him.  May God forgive them.
Islamophobia is completely justified because Islam is the religion of the Quran of which the unbeliever or infidel is to be killed in the most brutal means and  sharia law imposed.
Except there is no God.
"Arguing in neo-Marxist platitudes? Yes, that person was born a he, so it seems nature is 'anti-trans microaggressing,' according to your neo-Marxist Critical Gender Theory beliefs."
"For the Gay community and the Black community, both whom have been successfully pressing for broad inclusion to exclude the police whom the vast majority of people strongly support, is more than ironic.  It's just plain wrong.  Count me out his year."
"You must be a Republican.  Swirling black hole where your heart should be ... Hatriotism!!  Praying hard to the money gods while calling yourself a Christian, but we all know by now today's Christian is a 'christian'.  Super fakey!"
The gays need colonoscopy.
And don't forget that their version of Islam throws gays off buildings.
"Yeah, it's clearly too hard. Let's just give up and let the carnage continue."
That was simply an excuse... The average German soldier will claim they never fought to exterminate the Jews....
The Pharisees are the predecessors of rabbinical Judaism. Isn't it way past time Christians dropped the whole 'you killed our Lord!' talk?
Americans know something Canadians don't. No one really wants to look at a Muslim woman.
Amen brother
Considering transgender bathrooms 'fringe' is what will get you tarred and feathered in a modern university.  You are an 'old-fashioned Marxist' stuck in the 60s.
So what is the percentage of the 3 out of 1000 people that are transgendered that want to enter the military? Maybe the transgendered should pick other battles.
Lesbian reject men so why should men protect them?
"oh please, you think the session moderated by Independent Jewish Voices, a notoriously Israel and jew-hating organization, is going to be a fair and balanced discussion on human rights?  What utter nonsense."
"Knowledge is power. Less knowledge for the public means more power for the government and the elites. The powerful become more powerful, the powerless become more powerless. That's the way the powerful want it."
"Oh great, thanks to Trudeau Canadians are now effectively forced to buy Middle Eastern oil and to fund islamist terrorism whether they like it or not. Meanwhile, Paul Martin's shipping company can continue to lavishly profit from the tanker trade. Coincidence?"
"Fake Senator, Fake Tories, Fake Christians..."
Could we have a list of acts of terrorism committed by Syrians in North America? Or anywhere?
This clarifies the situation - or does it? Is the Queen gay?
"The law is cowardly.  These same Quebec Liberals went to the funerals of 6 dead Quebec City mosque members back on January, 2017.  Ten months later, they make a law that targets Muslims.  I guess for Quebec Liberals, the grieving period was over."
This is a huge mistake and a setback for acceptance of the gay community. If I lived in Toronto I would boycott the parade after this decision.
Maybe they should have a transgender division - the current system doesn't seem fair.
That explains all those Jews getting put to death in Israel for cursing their parents.../s
"I have to call bs here. I'm a churchgoing Christian, and there is nothing in our teachings that says it's okay to prey on young girls. These people are lunatics. It's not okay to generalize. There are lunatics in every faith (or non-faith)."
"London, as well as most of Europe, is deteriorating rapidly.  London now has a Muslim mayor which shows how they have infiltrated all levels of government."
"You conveniently don't mention your cohorts who call for extermination of Jews and Blacks. With guys like IQ006, IQ22, and the rest in your corner, well, I wouldn't call you  loathsome or deplorable like them but I think ' imbecile' has some merit for your selectivity."
Is  LBB  Barry  back  from  his  gay  sex romp  in   the  south  seas  yet?   When  he  left Moochelle at  home?
"At least in that they continue the traditions of the Church, as Saint Pope John Paul II the Great was a firm believer in protecting pedophile clergy."
Muslim prayers are certainly something to be afraid of.
"You are still saying that two deaths are better than one. Which is 'pro-death', not 'pro-life'.   You claim I am not a proper Catholic, which shows your innate arrogance."
Really? I guess you could just flood your data base with fictitious information and aliases but heaven help you if one of your aliases turns up being wanted by law authorities. Maybe the trans world where you can be 'fluid' has some merit (eyes rolling).
"Patsi writes:  'Tommy went out of his way to attack Paul Godfrey of the National Post for being Jewish. '  -  No, I've attacked him for being a failure as a CEO.  Never mentioned that he is Jewish.  Try harder to be accurate, Patsi."
Transgender people allowed in militaries of 18 countries' So what? The USA isn't one of them.
"***And for my next comment, I will channel Roy's justification for everything***  You want Trump to fire someone just because he doesn't like Jews?  What is this? Nazi Germany?"
"It doesn't make sense from a military perspective to ban transgender service members.  Trump tweeted it to shore up the homophobic sector of his base of supporters, which also includes racists, xenophobes, Islamophobes, and sexists."
"The Democrats use Antifa like the Muslim community uses radicals. They turn a blind eye to it until it is pointed out to them, then they shrug, throw up their hands and complain there is  nothing they can do."
You do realize that segregation of the sexes is not limited to Islam right? What about Orthodox Judaism? It's just as sexist. Come to think of it Catholicism is pretty sexist too.
"Dual citizen ship is a No No. One can not serve two masters. When one bows to master one its but is facing master two and vice versa. You come to Canada embrace it. If one is sceptical, Just do not apply for citizen ship fair enough."
"President Trump has been the most pro-Isreal president to date.. why would you hold him responsible for any anti-semitic acts? Why not blame the only people who still, to this day, hate jews? (im referring to the religion that literally preaches about killing jews.. and it rhymes with ShmIslam.)"
"That's funny. It's not like muslims have killed over 1,200 innocent people in terrorist attacks within the last month. Oh wait, yes they have.  https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/"
The only false equivalence is on your side. Christians have killed and terrorized throughout history in the name of God. You know it. Stop pretending.
Gay pornography?
The Queen's kids should hold another one this week. Flip the bird to the insecure world.
"You DO understand that the term 'progressive' and 'Conservative' are counter to each other, right? That is why they took it out to begin with. The proggy hate is string today."
"That would be people from both parties , I know many democratic and republican White Christian Gun Nuts that vote , Some are not party drones ."
"Self-hating Jews subscribe to the Forward. Jews in name only. Artificial Jews. Other than being born to a Jewish mother, you wouldn't know they were Jewish."
So funny and so hypocritical - coming from such a pro-Muslim crowd of politicians.
"Let's hope that the Liberals , by getting hit on the head by the 4 by 4 of reality, make some wise decisions... the ship of state was manouvered successfully through the global economic maelstrom by the previous government and now comes another."
The Israeli's like their combat females..a lot.  They also have no issues with transgendered military personnel.
Any adult who thinks he or she is a child suffers from some type of disorder. Most transgendered adults do not suffer from this disorder. I doubt there are too many baby-wannabes in the military.
"After 44 years of the P.C.s and decades of Social Credit before that, Albertans have had enough of the 'right' for a while and are willing to give the NDP a chance. We'll see in three years if the NDP deserves another mandate."
Good move. Obama's LOVE for all things anti-American and communist was irrational. No reason to support a muderous regime. Now NIX the Iran deal....and Obama's love for all things anti-American and islamic.
Jesus had two dads .Seems there are a few people out there who think he turned out ok .There are more reports of elected officials abusing kids in bathrooms than transgender folks .
Dostoevsky is turning over in his grave that the likes of you has appropriated that name.
Racial hatred and white nationalism are the glue that hold the Trump coalition together.  It is the duty of every Christian to oppose it.
"Stay far away ... and just keep your head in the sand and ignore the atrocities, the rapes, the killing. Yeah, that's a great plan."
Anti 'infidel' hate by Muslims has no place in MY Canada.
"Why do they need to do your bidding for you? Were you out denouncing white guys who shoot people after Vegas and every other shooting? No, so why do Muslims need to do it?"
" but to also dampen the traits of what makes America great, such as: compassion, inclusion, equal opportunity, fairness, equality, truth and justice.'-----------------------------In what fantasy world are they at?"
"Nope. We do NOT want to revisit the ideas of women's freedom and equality, thank you very much."
The 'liberals' trot out a family whose 'Muslim' son died defending your country and freedom and Trump continued the disrespect and insults afterwards. Case closed.
"Maybe he is a neo-nazi. Is the homeless man he falsely accused Jewish? Strangely enough, I feel a little better knowing that this is a hoax and that there really isn't a mentally ill homeless person running around stabbing hallucinations."
The BBC has reported that this is a terrorist attack by a Pakistani Muslim.
"and don't forget that the Jordanians destroyed Jewish houses of worship, religious artifacts (kind of like the Nazis). 1967 changed all of that"
How kind of the noble to speak english....
skyofblue: Rio is a well known poster who posts almost exclusively on jewish or Israel related stories.  He clearly has an agenda and would be happy if jews were eradicated completely.
"It is unlikely that many will ever go back. I agree that they should not have to endure the things you mentioned. However, it is also possible to protect them closer to home while ISIS is beaten back to the stone ages they belong."
Yeah ... you also said that about Trump's first Muslim ban.  How did that work out?
PIGL - Academics go where they can a job. If you teach political science or philosophy............
I wish gay men would just leave children alone.
"George Victor, you may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope some day you will join us, and the world will live as ONE."
Is this 'Jewish diatribe' your best effort? Have a coffee and think out something better.
The fact Fr. Martin seems to be all about homosexuality all the time makes me think he is a left-wing version of Michael Voris.
Fully agree ! It is a disgrace to mankind that women fail to be respected and appreciated more.
That's true now because a dirty little secret is coming out about male orgasm.  Men can experience orgasm without an erection.  You need to think about this TomZ and how this relates to gay men as well as older couples.
 ... we are all super fakey 'christians' that vote for the war machine and will stab our neighbors in the back for a buck or bugger boys hooked on crack ... '  We all know what 'focus on the family' REALLY means ...
That was precisely what made me realize that St. Paul was mere man and Jesus was God. Jesus never said such a stupid discriminating talk!
Hasn't even been a decade since 2011... or is your numeracy as poor as your literacy?
"Alabama people are too smart for the LEFTIST.. Thank you Judge Moore for running. They are scared of a Christian Conservative..A TRUE CONSERVATIVE. Sincerely,  Florida"
Christian Supremacist. Now that is something Canadians should be concerned about.
"My God, that pantsuit!  Is that Hill of Beans or a transgender from Saturday Night Fever.?"
"A tricky issue. 'Past homosexuals' are pretty much all dead of AIDS. And they have no descendants, so who do you apologize to?"
Trouble is there are reasons why some muslims become radicalized.  The Donald's plan ignores all this and just was discrimination against muslims.  Pretty Dumb when you consider it is generally years before they become radicalized.
Same for me and he stands in a long line of good Catholic writers over the centuries who have used humor to point out the follies of the 'whitened sepulchers' who are destroying the church by their blinded eyes and hardened hearts.
"As goes for all special interest groups. No more making private lives public. Hench no more gay pride parades, no more (fill in the blank) protest. Agree yes ?"
Scot...you've missed a medication dose today?
I doubt the accuracy of your statement. Please give your reference. There is a lot of misinformation which is not helpful. Money would not be wasted if solid partnerships were formed. As Wab Kinew says it is not that saviours are needed it is allies.
"Let me get this straight, There is no friend anywhere . . . because some Globe posters are opposed to Trump's executive orders, you hate muslims more?  And seven other posters agree with you?  That's a head-shaker."
"They were assimilators, not invaders.'  Go tell that one to Palestinians.  The point of previous comments was about how Canada and the US turned the Jews back during the holocaust which we should all have learned a lesson from.  However, it appears that certain Trump supporters are quite incapable of learning."
"I doubt if the imaginary sky-being that JT 'worships', is one that hates homosexuals, hates gay-marriage, believes there's a lake of fire for homosexuals later. But the radicals supporting scheer do so. So I'm as certain as you that it's a different zeus than yours and theirs."
"The moral authority speaks, the robo's dance and vote."
"Sure, run tranny Mike, see how badly she gets beat. Republicans would love it."
"What's the matter, James, Hitler didn't kill enough Jews for your liking?"
"I provided many examples of transgender people going back for quite some time, thousands of years. Don't assume. Read the links. In India the Hijra have records going back 4000 years. The evidence is out there. It helps to read it."
What makes you an expert on using natural gas fired turbines for electrical generation? Have you ever designed or built one? Or are you just being your typical blowhard?
"I am an older transgender person, I vigorously oppose this legislation. I have made a video on the topic that I hope people will watch: https://youtu.be/x-txjWzJQjU . The western world is quickly going absolutely insane."
Fedar is a Homo.
Its mostly run by lesbians now.
"So has Christianity. This is one man, one case. There are a few boneheads but this is not 'widely abused'."
Wrong. None of the people at the vigil were involved in Reconstruction or the Indian Wars. To blame them for it is a RACIST statement. Kinda like blaming today's Jews for crucifying Jesus.
Happy to see you left Juneau for Anchorage Michae....One less homosexual is always good news.
"Didn't think the police arm themselves to kill Jews, Blacks, and any other races opposed to white supremacy."
"So?  They're all conditions which are managed individually based on their situation.  Why couldn't you do the same with transgendered? Jeez, they're people who WANT to serve their country, unlike our Commander in Chief...lol...."
Too many left wing loons running this country. We are doomed.
"Or it is heartbreaking for a segregationist American southerner that his Lord is much darker than him.  Plus most of those churches were built after Europeans had seen Jews. The original Jews were darker that the Europeans. Centuries of intermixing, rape, etc have made some Jews blonde and blue eyed."
"Mulroney was personally responsible for destroying the PC's, such was the level of hatred towards him by all Canadians. Even Stephen Harper was able to leave the Conservative Party intact, with a good showing at the last election."
Homosexuals are men right?
‘Do Sunni and Shia Muslims pray together in the Muslim prayer rooms in our Ontario public schools?’ I often wondered that myself. Doesn’t one sect call the other heretics?
"It's ok. The guy wasn't Muslim, so no big deal."
Anti-gay training'......what sophistry !!  LOL
What a flimsy editorial built around a one-line quip that exactly characterized PM Stephen Harper's behavior and the idea that Canada has to do airstrikes because so many others are.
"Natural law:   When a Church is filled with gay clergy, thousands of boys end up getting raped by these gay priests.  The Church has been right all along about homosexuality.   Trouble is, gay people have an inexplicable attraction to the RCC."
like when the Imam's spew hatred and citing scriptures against Jews and infidels.  We apparently have no problem with that.
truly an astounding feat that you managed to read all 500 words of this article and stay focused! That's a lot of hard work for someone like you. Keep it up!
Actually prayer before all of those activities you mentioned and many more is the way we should conduct our lives. What Prayer can do is open your perspective and it helps you see solutions that might not have been considered other wise
Hatred? Irrational or rational? Islamophobic?
When are they bringing Dr. Porter back to be a Conservative Senator. The world is so predictable. Mr. Harper ...resign. This si getting close. I hope the RCMP still have some honour enough to pursue the OINKERS to the top.
Seriously? A guy has to apologize for not being black or trans?  These are weird times indeed.
It's disgusting that any terror attack by muslims has comments closed.  free speech is dead in mainstream media.  I'm sure this will be deleted.
This is a great example of the sort of insensitive trans language usage that is twisting even people who agree that trans rights are human rights. ' ---------------------------- Agreed. There is a big danger that even sympathetic people will begin to feel alienated and push back.
"Legally and factually dubious claims about the law became the platform to oppose equality for trans and gender non-binary Canadians, cloaking the underlying transphobia that animated the opposition.'  Wow. Do the authors really believe this about their opponents?"
"Look everyone, Muslims are great! Says the mainstream media narrative anyway. A Muslim a few days ago tried to behead people with a sword outside of Buckingham Palace in London but the MSM wouldn't reveal his identity because, again, Muslims are great!"
Is this about Canada or the Conservative party? Perhaps some real generosity of spirit might make this noteworthy.
Pat Robertson is the man to call in:  http://politicot.com/pat-robertson-trumps-macho-groping-tape-orchestrated-god-show-americans-hes-definitely-not-gay/
"Obama was good at the Propaganda he was given.  Like Billy Clinton he was a narcissist and borderline sociopath, and just read the scripts he was given while Wall Street fleeced America dry.  Funny how the feminists, socialists, communists, transgenderists and all the other -ists, like to pretend that didn't happen."
I'll be curious to see how Mr. Trump's Jewish son-in-law continues to 'advise' his father-in-law in view of the tsunami of anti-semitic hatred Trump's supporters are unleashing.
"Agree completely. I think that if one reads the wisdom of the sages of every culture, from Seneca to Laotzu, one finds that stoicism in one form or another is the key."
I'm a lesbian trapped in a man's body.'  Might work.
It was also bound to get his base all tied up in some ridiculous hate of transgenderism.  You're being played.
The fact that the catholic church has paid it's victims millions of dollars shows it is corrupt. In Ireland it is murderous.
"What's wrong with saying 'Happy Holidays' and honoring all Americans, plus giving a nod to New Years Day, another 'holiday', which we all celebrate?  I don't have anything against wishing Jewish people a happy holiday."
We all know what the problem is and the governments in the west wont admit it. Immigrants and welfare.
"Yes, according to Catholic teaching.  A truly objective and persuasive reason.  Gimme a freaking break!"
"Naturally, in her usual rush to dismiss alternative energy Wente completely omits the enormous capital, operating, environmental, and human costs of fossil fuel production and use, which dwarf any expenditures on wind and solar."
What does Trump have to do to prove he is not anti-gay  Hold Justin's hand and march in 3 Pride Parades ?
"Well this might not be that well written but as a life-long Vancouverite I think he's spot on. It also speaks to the thin-skinned nature of our city that so many are so offended.'But, but, we're so world-class!' Lol."
"we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin, 10as it is written: ‘There is no one who is righteous, not even one'' -- Romans 3:9-10"
"Yes, Charlie. It was wrong to put the Cossacks out of work."
I never threaten.  Neither you nor your transgender 'wife'.
"There will be little to debate as any study that questions transgenderism will never receive funding, and if somehow funded, will never be published.  When scientific debate and research is censored in this manner, we are entering scary times."
It's a dead heat so crooked Hillary is just as likely to lose as Trump. Let's hope Trump pulls it out and helps the middle class that have been forgotten.
those Kenyans!!!!! ...per capita metric tons of C02 emmisions stands at .3.....Canada stands at 17.....
"Turing was persecuted because he was gay, even after his heroism in the war.  That is the type of society we had in the west when the Church had more 'leadership.'  The same ethic is trying to block women priest, but it is dying out."
My side won. Yours lost. The whining is from the very people who said Trump would never win.
Dumb and dumber?
screw islam n dummy troudeau you want more islamist dummy move to the desert build youre own outhousesn start building with your money not canadians most dont want more islamists bring more jews french greeks lebs forget the stupid bunch
"Interesting point. Here again the left has step in it. I think it is the same, refusing is refusing. The because is the issue. And with the left the because is they agree with gays, and not with supremacists."
"People of Canada and the world need to get behind Justin, Obama, Hillary and Premier Wynne in our fight against fascism, Islamophobia, homophobia, anti-semitism and discrimination against Transgenders!"
"Anyone but Justine in 2019!  If you're not a transgender, refugee on welfare well, you're not welcome in Justine's tent."
I won't be waiting. Liberals have turned fence sitting into an artform.
You are a mere 180 degrees off.
"Hmm.  Gayness is great, right?"
"Sanity has been restored at the White House.  It is unfortunate that trans gender people think as they do, but it is ludicrous to force the majority of people to change social norms to accommodate how people think."
"Unless you have some proof, you are deliberately trying to promote hatred against these people who have been repeatedly victimized.  Do you say the same about the Jews?"
"Canada, Sweden and Holland will be the only of 190 countries of the UN to have transgender soldiers . When captured by ISIS then what?  Putting transgender soldiers in danger . not very politically correct you can bet ISIS will have no  transgender prisons and no  transgender washrooms"
"Actual Marxists, who are generally atheists, could not care less about Quanta Cura. It is like having an Orthodox Jew caring about what the Bhagavad Gita has to say.  Catholics, on the other hand, assuming they have ever heard of QC, tend to ignore it."
"Because he was getting out of the way of his cousin, the Christ. He deliberately spoke out against the sinfulness of the King.  He was not stupid, he knew the consequences."
"Actually, they aren't making the law, they are following it. Unlike our Prime Minister who swore to uphold the law."
who cares
so that justifies the killing of Christians?
The teaching of Paul IV is more likely to have led many to hell -- or to have led them to construct a hell on earth for Jews. 'By their fruits you shall know them.'
"You know this was an Obama supporter, ... how? Because conservative anti-Semite thugs are always so respectful of Jewish synagogues and cemeteries? And, ... don't get upset when people call Trump derogatory names."
The vast majority of white supremacists profess to be 'Christians.'
"Can I sue a business owner who does not serve gays if they think I am gay but am not but refuse to provide a service to me?'  I think you probably can, and successfully."
"I like ranked ballots because it reverse the narrowcasting that parties now do. I also think it comes closer to reflecting the wishes of the most voters. No more majorities? Good, lets start working together more often."
That one looks Jewish and that one's a coon. Who let all this riff raff into the room? There's one smoking a joint and another with spots. If I had my way I'd have all of you shot.'- Pink Floyd
"And vice versa though...where are the defenders of the niqab? Why are they not also here, defending the religious right of Catholics to their beliefs?"
"And we must disrupt a church of princes with an ancient irrelevant theology that discriminates against women, gays, and people of other religions and abuses children while protecting abusers."
Yes that's why I used a balanced example of a white transgender female political figure and a half-black male political figure.    The pinata was brought to class by a student so I don't fault the teacher at all.
trudeaux father was still in kneepants when this incident occurred. why should this current pm nincompoop go stirring up history now? answer; he hopes it will get him more Jewish votes when this pathetic excuse for a leader is thrown out of office.
Just as an aside ....and truth be told the Jews did start killing every german they could find immediately after the war and by some estimates killed more germans than germans killed jews
"Not to mention that Sharia Law is a central tenet of Islam, making it incompatible with our constitution. I'd rather see permanent western military bases over there creating safe zones so they can enjoy their home country rather than trying to subvert ours."
"Beautifully stated! All people, both straight and gay, are capable of sinning sexually when we objectify our sexual partner, even if that partner is our lawfully wedded spouse. Thank you for pointing out the kind of sexual ethic that really matters - for everyone."
Don't white supremacists hate Jews? Trump is surrounded by Jews. His daughter is a convert and his son in law is Orthodox Jewish.
"the homeless jew knows where he can buy a house for $12,000......he would get a job but prison and jail made him to crazy to work......and there are not to meny places that will let him work becouse he is a voilent offender....so dose eney budy have $12,000..... ???"
"NP, I think you misread Klastri's comment.  It said, 'fundamentally evil when it comes to LGBT folks and women's rights,' meaning as he relates to those issues, not on the whole as your interpretation."
"Liberals have gone insane saying you can discriminate against people's feelings about themselves, and that is exactly what this transgender stuff is all about."
Really? Did you demand that Trump prove that Obama was a Kenyan Muslim?
Harper-crites unite!
"there is no such thing as a trans anything, you are either a man or a woman, the only 2 possibilities."
"It's easy to understand. The a**holes and smart-alecks here simply pretend not to, are blinded by malice and/or partisanship, and/or of subnormal intelligence. Your typical Conservative Party voter, in other words."
"the homeless jew knows where he could buy a house for $12,000......he would get a job but .....he has a long voilent crimele recorde....and prison and jail made him to crazy to work....."
Unlike Harpocrits he didn't take the money. Now crawl back into your box.
"Omar is a Right Wing religious fundamentalist. There is always place in a Conservative Cabinet for that type. Reverse gay rights, abortion rights, minority rights, etc."
Did you know that president Trump's son-in-law is Jewish and his daughter Ivanka is a converted Jew?  I thought I would sprinkle a little 'truth' around.
"Well, 'everyone' is wrong. ISIL is a sideshow. Assad is the greater evil and Canada should have no part of any deal that accepts any role for Assad."
"How do you know that there was a medieval global warming. Did you personally experience it? Oh, scientists told you about it and you believe them. The same scientists who you disbelief when they talk about global warming."
Just rough gay sex getting a little out of hand.
"Wow, if only we had elected officials who channeled their outrage over the transgender experiment toward fixing this issue maybe we could actually accomplish something.  While everyone focuses on the 'outrage' of Trump's tweet, we have people dying because of failed policy."
uhhh WHO CARES!  We are $20 Trillion in debt and who cares about the 3 transgender people in this state
Give the finger to the society? Perhaps they choose the wrong society to live in.
A Jew can become a gentile and a gentile can become a Jew but a man cannot become a woman nor a woman a man.
"My point?   You focused on his Jewish donors and his racial attributes - without saying why they're relevant.  Most people who do that are racists and/or bigots.  I didn't want to jump to that conclusion about you, so I asked you to clarify your comment."
"MaryJay1, You sound like my kind of woman. We need to get together and unite the left. Do you believe in the hereafter? Then you know what I'm here after."
So does Trump hate Jews or is he in bed with Israel?  The media needs to make its mind up and have a consistent narrative to sell why we should hate Trump.   What a joke!
I wonder when will the children of Palestine go Gaza to give respect to their loved ones!
a bishop who enables a pedophile priest should be excommunicated and in a prison cell'  Is Law in a cell in the Vatican's prison?
"Les, Yes and public places...Gay night clubs, Schools, Company parties, Shopping malls. The list is endless. We are not safe. We need huge government expansion."
"Really, R.D?  How many transgendered persons do you know personally?"
Orthotoxic faux Christianity NEEDS to be warred against.
"Because they stand up and have pride in their province (Quebec), and stand against islamic/muslim tyranny . The rest of everyone in all of the other provinces are just sheeple. They've either succumbed to the inevitable, or just don't care anymore."
"Because it is a necessary, but not sufficient condition. But supporting those conditions requires a collective effort."
"It should not, but it should be careful in what it calls sin.  No one is rejecting the concept of sin.  Assaulting people because they are gay is always sinful, mortally so."
Jews are the least inclusive people I can think of. Try moving to Israel and see how inclusive they are.
"Israel, and those that support it, pretend to hold higher standards."
"There is no science that supports transgender. How can we scream at the climate science deniers and at the same time support government policy decisions that are based on personal agendas and not on science? If you are born male or female, that's what you are. Period"

List of ' Christian terrorists' -  sorry this page is blank
What can be more 'balanced' than a white transgender female and a black straight male?
So you are complaining about human nature. Your argument seems to suppose that all the budget issues are the result of this self interest when the story shows that pretty much every voter has an element of self interest. So much for your argument.
"But what is the intent behind the law? Are there really that many people wearing the niqab, which is uncommon even in most of the Islamic world? When I lived in the Middle East, it was either Saudi women or much older Arab women who normally wore it."
Keep telling yourself that the Palestinians firing rockets and missiles into civilian Jewish areas of a sovereign nation is not a violation of international law......you might convince yourself eventually.
"The difference is that transgendered individuals are quite capable of performing their duties.  After all, 18 countries including Canada, Israel, Australia, Britain, Germany and France currently allow transgendered individuals to serve openly and it doesn't seem to have impacted their military readiness."
"Richard, are you referring to the russian spetsnaz with advanced weaponry who portray themselves as 'regular' Ukrainians? Nice try comrade."
"Some priests should be put out to pasture. I'm sorry that you ever had to hear such a wrong thing, John. The inability to have a perspective on what is really pro-life will kill what's left of this Church."

"What a hypocrite. Kenny, a 49 year old bachelor, when asked about his own sexual persuasion, has replied that he doesn't discuss his private life with journalists. http://www.canadalandshow.com/kd-lang-asks-jason-kenney-if-hes-gay/ So, it's monstrously unfair of him to breach the privacy of teens by recommending parents be told their kids have joined a gay-straight alliance."
The Royal Alexander? Did the Tsar visit TO in the 19th C. or are you being facetious?
"I believe that within 15 or 20 years, people like you will be pretending they were people like us and wondering why people weren't shouting louder."
"He should have condemned first and foremost the POTUS himself who, no later than last week at a press conference, broke loose on an Orthodox Jew journalist trying to ask him a question, qualifying twice his question (that the poor guy was unable to complete) as 'disgusting'."
"The suffix 'Jr.' Should only be used when the son has the same first name as the father. Ironically, with your use of the word as an attempt to suggest he is a man of lesser competence you have demonstrated your own lack of competence."
At least Trump's wife is actually a woman and not a tranny like his predecessor's 'wife' is.
"That's pretty presumptive and not very Christian of you, you hater."
HI:'Muslims have the most to lose from Barcelona' NO. The people that lost their lives and loved ones have the most to loose. Why is their answer/solution death????
Having a gay husband?
This is Muslims doing what Muslims do.  Why do they expect anything different from Islam?  Do they not look at history?
"The owner was willing to sell them a standard off-the-shelf cake, but he refused to discuss designing any cake -- solely because the couple was gay. It is one thing to object to a specific design. It's quite another to refuse to discuss any design."
"Disgusting excuse for progressive Catholic journalism that smears most of America as racist.  Hateful, worthless, stupid, harmful, irresponsible, and untrue."
"Good Lord Jack***, did you just say Iran has never threatened the US? That's right, you did, in the third sentence.  But 'Death to America' daily chants by angry Iranians, ARENT a threat?  Jack, I believe you are practicing Taqiyya and a closet Muslim."
Cultural Darwinism at work. The weaker culture is moved aside by the stronger.
"Liberal progressive democrats are the pathetic masses of whom Stalin had often referred to as useful idiots.   The indoctrination is complete, free speech is dead with the democrats.  If you're right of lgbtq communists transgenders, then you're a NAZI..."
I've heard this claim before but haven't been able to substantiate it. Could you help and provide your source that proves the Prime Minister made the offer of help?
Looks like Assad and the Rusians know how to deal muslim terrorists
In Toronto anti-Islamophobia protesters outnumbered anti-Muslim protesters by a ratio of 30-1.  Just remember that Islamophobic bloggers. You will never win. Canadian society is tolerant and inclusive and Muslims will be welcome here.
Gays got a whole tale.
National Post article 10 days ago regarding UN resolution. Jewish donors feel betrayed by Obama.
Since when is it 'shunning' to deny Communion? Another poster claimed Paprocki had ordered all gay people to be buried in 'unmarked graves.' Insanity!
White is more controlling than is Catholic. Nothing new here.
"Just think...if it was Hilary under the bridge, she could have arranged abortions for all the pregnant nanny goats and sex-reassignment surgery for the trans-goats."
Surely the catholic church should concentrate on it's dwindling numbers and paedophiles
"Don’t ever trust Labradors, they will always betray you"
This election in Alberta will come down to jobs vrs transgendered bathrooms.   Even the  lgbt community needs jobs.    Kenney will win handily except in Edmonton and central Calgary.
"Margaret, what do you mean by 'some'? All transgender activists are denying science. There is no science to support this belief."
"Jesus said the 2nd greatest commandment is love thy neighbor as thyself, the Golden Rule, which Mr Phillips and the rest of the fake Christians like him violate regularly."
"so, you like making people sick, then. you're in safe hands."
None of these other religions force women to wear scarves or cover themselves.  None of these other religions murders gays and lesbians. None of these other religions treats women as second class subjects.
"The 'violence against conservatives' comment is ludicrously hypocritical when one considers the rash of horrific violent crimes commited by right wing extremists like Robert Dear, Dylan Roof, and Jeremy Christian."
Threats are crimes. Do you think the Jews in the synagogue in Charlotsville felt threatened when the Nazis marched past chanting their hateful slogans or do you think they were snowflakes?
"ya thats it blame the jews for living in thier own land, what bs"
"National security' is only important to Trump if it means keeping those dang Muslim and Mexican furriners out of the US. Hiring Flynn, an unhinged conspiracy theorist and compromised liar, as national security advisor is fine, of course."
These attacks on the gay community have to stop
Why did our PM choose to present that image' ? The same reason that snakes slither. He can't not make everything about himself and his self importance.
"It's not the ban on sex outside marriage that is discriminatory, as it applies equally to everyone.    What's discriminatory is that that married straight students are allowed to have sex while married gay students are not."
"Lets just combine the Catholic church and the Boy Scouts organizations into one entity.    They both have been doing the same thing FOREVER,  ABUSING and having Intestinal Intercourse with young boys."
As usual you missed the point. Trump and Clinton are playing by different rules. He gets to be a the new guy in town that everybody wants to watch and she's old news unless she's tripped up. Women are held to a much higher standard.
No. Strict enforenforcement is the only way. Trans people deserve no less.
"Good. It's about time Russia and Russians got their comeuppance for supporting anti-Semitic and anti-Israel motions at the UN, thereby putting Jews and Israelis in the line of fire from inveterate international anti-Semites who wish nothing more than the demise of Jews and Israelis."
Latino's for tRump is like Jews for Hitler....
Justin and Adams deserve each other - political opportunists
Classical lies. Nobody is threatening to bomb Jewish kids people.   The call came from within the office. This isn't some sophisticated prank. Its typical Zio behavior.
I think MikeAA is an embarrassment to the Catholic Faith.  Certainly he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
You don't understand international finance do you fatty.
"He speaks to my wife in English, with a Brooklyn Jewish accent."
"Just say NO to all religion, everywhere! It's archaic teachings with no basis in truth or reality are are just an indoctrination of fear to control the masses. If a so-called 'Jesus' was immortal, how can his death be a sacrifice? Circular bible logic at it's finest!"
Thanks for a thoughtful comment. We need to get back to government that does 'what's good for Canada' rather than 'what's good for the party'.
israel is surrounded by muslims that are committed to its destruction ( including Iran)
Nice if you would mention the women too.
"Catholic' scholars? A laughable assertion, that. Thank goodness no one reads or listens to the National 'Catholic' Reporter anymore."
"I had no doubt you would see it that way...A Lesbian who has an affair, allegedly on school property doing school hours is not enough smoke to assume there is a fire ? Would you be interested in buying the Fairy Street Bridge ?"
Trump was going to ball all the transgender people? Who knew he had it in him?
"Have you ever worked for extended periods in Japan?  I have. Discrimination against the Gaijin is intense, if cleverly understated in the public domain. If you're going to make derogatory comments about a group of people, Christians for example, try not to look silly doing so."
"Being masculine, caring and respectful have never been mutually exclusive."
Muslims would absolutely never allow their children to be taught comparative religion That could lead to questions and that could lead to e apostasy which is punishable  by death.
Bibi has alot of friends in Hollywood with Geffen records maybe Bibi could make a few phone calls. Trump Loves Bibi and Putin. Traditional Jewish music with a slice of Cossack dancers. Menu; Kosher food with Russian Vodka.
The question was : 'Please name one country where 'gaiety' is punishable by death.'  Your response was about gays and had nothing to do with gaiety.
Funny how you failed to acknowledge the other half of the statement--that Trumpty-Dumpty is every bit an amoral sham as Hillory the Blood Countess.  Kind of like how bigoted Christians justify their arrogance by quoting the bible out of context.
Where is the money coming from to pay for all the transgender bathrooms we will be ordered to build?
White Christians perhaps; not white evangelicals who are definitely not the majority!
Who cares what the Downtown Toronto Cocktail Party Circuit thinks.? The PM is right. The people stand with him.
This is the problem with transgendered people.  /s
The lives of 'thousands' of transgender people have been thrown into 'chaos' because they now can't openly join the military - give me a break.
"Yeah, socialists want to exterminate Jews, like that Jewish guy Bernie wants to do.  I'd say the level of ignorance and lack of education is comical, except it's so detrimental to our country. Read a book sometime."
"Sure Nathan - going to the Muslim war zone aka Xinjing where Saudi funded terrorists are routinely blowing themselves up , and trying to interview the terrorist sympathizers to do a story on 'oppression' is such an great idea. You deserve full of it."
If justice has no expiry date world history would come to a dead stop and God could not create enough lawyers to untie the knot !!!
Trump will probably blame some Muslim guy for getting him drunk.
"Mr. Bernier’s team said the Scheer victory was due to the social-Conservative vote and the strong showing of candidate Brad Trost, who expressed his discomfort during the race with “the whole gay thing” ....... ======= Yeah, you can't be a conservative by that ...."

"It's not a Muslim ban, it's a ban against countries known to support/protect/harbor terrorists and non-Muslim countries are in that list like North Korea and soon The Banana Republic of Hawaii will be added to it despite being an actual US state! LOL"
your name is redundant.
"... isn't that what 'christians' like yourself do, 'hide the perverts' within the Church all while fudging paperwork as to what is really going on ... always more money to tithe to support the efforts/paying out lawsuits!!  :)"
I have to be careful not to disparage a practice that allows a man to divorce by uttering some word 3 times? Even by phone or text? What are you smoking?
"Canadian patriotic fervor = Good. American patriotic fervor = Bad. Well, anything American is bad."
"Nobody but socialists, Liberals,  Democrats and people in the news media believe  Muslims."
"Doctors should practice medicine, not morality. They are professionals; they should keep to their profession in their work."
More sitting republicans have gone be found to be being creepy in bathrooms than the entire trans community.   Maybe we need to ban Republicans males from bathrooms?
Let's not jump to conclusions ... Aaaaaaannnddddd it's ISLAM
A clear case of putting it's people first shows me that our Trudeau government is on the right track.
Huh.  I wonder how the Jews in Germany in the 1930s would have fared had they had automatic weapons.  Don't be naive; not everyone is a pacifist.
... 'christians' have that mastered ...
Jews are doing what any other people would do: resist terrorism. Palestinians are doing what no one else would do: engaging in terrorism and stabbing innocent civilians.
"Like Tim Tebrow , Kapernick is a Christian activist. Go for the obvious , white Tebrow is a national hero and black Kapetnick needs to learn his place on the plantation."
Yer transgender phobia is unwarranted fake Beaver.
"If you believe that no lawyer should represent someone you (or they) feel is guilty, then you have no right to comment on our system of justice. You know nothing about it. Educate yourself a little before you next vote, please."
One problem is that the Jewish community is too tied up with supporting Israel. Do they have allegiance to Israel 1st and Canada 2nd?  'The Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver referred a request for comment to the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs.'
"Ooh, an opinion by the Post.  I must immediately change my views.  Hillary could burn down an orphanage filled with transgendered children of color and beat them with Gibson guitars as they came running out and the Post would still giver her their support."
"Wombat, despite my strong opposition to transgendered people serving in the military, I have to agree with you on every single point mentioned here.  Although I agree with Trump on many points, he himself is an idiot."
Holy mother of god what a dunce
uh ...it is well known that she has had a string of lesbian affairs and even fathered a child of Web Hubbels
but still an Islamic terrorist
Too funny.
I'm sure in your mind this has something to do with transgender people serving in the armed forces of the United States.  WOW!
"I disagree with mandating gay Boy Scout leaders when we have decades of perverts using the Boy Scouts as grooming locations.  Not all homosexuals are pedophiles; but, the hundreds who have been convicted in Boy Scout Troops of abuse is justification to prohibit them."
Rapeing ancient cultures the hobby of the corporate Christian lobby.
Typical liberal Jew. Where is Hitler when we need him?
"Hey pal, it's LGBTQ2S, not LGBTQQ2S - what sort of homophobic monster are you?"
The biggest losers will be people living in Scarborough. So be it.
LMAO! I'm sure christian nutjobs praying in islamic countries  at a public school(!)  would be murdered if they did this
"Muslims are not coming to Canada  to supplement us, but to supplant us."
"Patterning makes the pederasts. In the seminaries, some gay men simply come out while others adopt the asexual ideal imposed on them as a way of regaining latency."
Deception is an integral part of the Muslim Brotherhood's modus operandi.
"Considering how badly the church treats them, it's amazing that there are any women -- let alone nuns -- who remain in the church. May G_D bless them because their church doesn't much care about them."

"Does pointing out that a growing majority of Americans support adultery (abortion, same sex marriage, even theft), change God's law an iota?"
In think let Biko also know that his sons Andile Mngxitama and BLF are obnoxious racists and antisemites who makes fun of the Holocaust and how Jews were 'turned into soap' by the Nazis. But would you expect of an intrinsically and explicitly racist ideology.
The Inquisition is not the only alternative to tossing gay men off buildings.   There are a lot of other options.
So you're down with female mutilation and executing homosexuals eh Len?  http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/22/health/detroit-genital-mutilation-charges/
Do your jewish friends know that you 'like' online comments that say that 'the zionists' control Canada?
"Mr Harper has been around just about ten years, it's time to go, then we need to lobby for term limits and a PR voting system so we can return to real democracy."
Transgender athletes..... Transgender students.....  This is what feminism gets you in society.  This was unheard of only a short 20 years ago.
Thanks for the little dose if common sense
"Wearing swastikas, making zeig heil salutes, shouting 'blood and soil' and 'Jews will not replace us' and championing an ideology that executed millions of civilians is a more accurate definition of fascism. Unless of course you're a Nazi apologist..."
Conservatives have raised fears about men or boys claiming to be transgender in order to spy or prey on women or girls in public restrooms.' -Well then those 'conservatives' should be more concerned about the president being in any room with a woman or girl.
"What a sterile argument.  Remember Canon 1083 #3: 'sterility neither nullifies nor prohibits marriage.'  If sterile straights can get married and have sterile sex then so can loving gay couples. There really is no difference, Ken."
"Trudeau, nice hair, good smile. Complete lack of substance on issues. Way to go."

"This is an example of the arrogance and ignorance that exemplifies Anchorage and is the same as a bunch of ugly racist and bigoted White Nationalist Americans moving to Israel and then have the gall to tell Israelis, 'Jews, you're lucky we let you stay here.'"
"Precisely. He's forever sulking about how gay people have (mis)appropriated the use of words like 'gay' and 'LGTB' while he's doing his level best to re-appropriate the use of scary words 'sodomy' and 'sodomite.' Sadly for him, it isn't working."
We don't elect a leader. Trudeau wasn't/isn't crazy. All three were competent. Your comparison simply isn't relevant.
"And since it wasn't transgender, they refused to use it!"
"My thought exactly when I read that he frequented gay nightclubs. I don't know whether you saw but even two days ago, someone posted here that this would turn out to be like the clinic arson."

self servingnaked ambitionbad temperament... Anyone on the left may be just once consider writing a puff piece on HRC? Lie to me!
The (in)famous 1917 Balfour Declaration to Baron Rothschild on Palestine (as it was then called) perfectly encapsulates the root of the conflict: a colonial power pledging to European Jews land that belongs to neither.  That Canada continues to effectively support this travesty is shameful.
"I have long learned to eschew the bigotry, hypocrisy, and ignorance of the libtard generation. Israel is the Jewish answer to the Holocaust. One of the most successful nations on earth, fool."

"How many times do I have to tell you? He didn't say he was open and transparent, he said that he was open to trans parents."
"You live next to a base, which of course, makes you an expert. Based on this post, I can see that you are indeed an expert. Clearly, you have a PhD... Proctology I presume."
What is wrong with these crazy anti-racists and ridiculous pro-transgender nuts? Don't they know the revolution is about stopping classism?
So you go out of your way to see films about gay people. Most actual straight guys I know don't do that. They couldn't care less. You seem to care an awful lot for a 'straight' guy. Just sayin'.
"Shouting hateful slogans about Jews, using Nazi language, can't be considered a 'peaceful' march. Regardless of what happened after and how, the march was violent in purpose and meaning."
You mean it wasn't a blonde blue eyed baptist yelling 'alluh akbar'   SHOCKING.  Radical Islamic Terror? Again?   (I bet by the end of day all of the ISIS apologists and sympathizers will be all over this wall defending radical Islam)  It's like Christmas everday with President Trump.
One thing I do know is that our Lord would most certainly 'have a problem' with a Clinton presidency which would have opened the floodgates to infanticide and homosexual unions.
"It's Mass!!!  Jeez, Catholics can't even spell it correctly!  Always a capital M!  Always!"
The biggest problem with the residential school system was allowing the Catholic church to get involved. We all know what perverts those priests can be with little children.
"Like I've been saying, Trump is not a racist with a Jewish son in law, convert daughter and Jewish grandchildren. Along with a black friend Dr. Ben Carson. Honesty? Who is the bigger liar, Hillary or Trump? I will say Hillary."
"If you believe in Jesus and live with that belief, you will find that you have a perfect peace continuously regardless of what life throws at you and that you enjoy living every day with a joy which cannot be described. You should try it some time."
There lies the difference.   Jesus and Christianity teaches love.    Islam teaches hate.
"He was an excellent marksman. Was he Muslim? I hope, otherwise we cannot blame them."
"Today's realities'... please, these realities were imposed upon these people who were doing just fine and would continue to thrive not for our destructive intervention. Now it is the duty of Canadians to make these people whole."
It foments anti-Muslim animus.
He was an atheist who hated Christians. He might as well have been ISIS.
"The anti-discrimination protection law talks about male and female.  Please do not take this as the wrong way, but which one would a transgender fall under?  Self identified or by chromosomes?    For one or the other will cover them in the male female legal classification."
What a wonderful and inspiring display of spontaneous outrage.  Where was the spontaneous outrage when children were being molested?  The Church of Jesus sure could have used some then.  Maybe next year there should be a Fortnight for Hypocrisy.
">>Canada is showing support to Poland, a nation that was raped by both the Nazis and the SovietsAnd where was Canada when Poland was invaded by the USSR? Canada was an ally of the Soviet Union and supported the invasion."
"Homosexual 'marriage' is a public sinful act, recognized as such by the Canon Law and leading de facto to excommunication"

"If a black student made a 'joke' about a holocaust victim or something jewish, no one would be commenting here - that student would be gone."
The $90 million per year the US spends on its soldiers' sexual health covers 1.3 million active service members. The (say) $5 million the US spends on transgender issues covers perhaps a couple hundred individuals. Do you not see where the greater cost effectiveness lies?
I wasn't aware that there were anti-Semite Jews.  Interesting news.
I don't know whose more clueless: the reporters or the counter protesters. Study Islamic law before you open your mouths.
The latest chapter in the Globe's never-ending hatchet job on Harper. Wonder what comparisons are coming next? Hitler? Stalin?

"No, it has happened.  The liberal media just won't report it cause they're covering for the trannies."
"Lawyer Kim In-sook said the military penal code, which makes homosexual activity punishable by up to two years in prison, was unconstitutional because it tramples on basic human rights and dignity.  Yes, chomping on someone’s genitalia is really dignified."
Trump's been upset about this ever since he found out Melania is transgender.
How many parents abuse their kids for not following Christian values?
How is a gay couple a federally protected class? Federal protected classes include:  •Race. •Color. •Religion or creed. •National origin or ancestry. •Sex. •Age. •Physical or mental disability. •Veteran status. •Genetic information. •Citizenship.

The yobs in Charlottesville were chanting 'Jews will not replace us.'
"I've yet to see one Catholic progressive here say that violence is unacceptable.   Instead, many here are saying that millions of Americans are fascists and racists, and this implies that they believe these Americans are criminals who should be defeated by any means necessary."
It puts an end to the old socialist lie that women are inherently superior to men in how they yield public office. But now they are still pushing the agenda that women are inherently superior to men in the board rooms of big business.
Damn lies.
Muslim Terrorist Attack.
"[... it appears officials were unaware of the incidents uncovered by The Globe]As Upton Sinclair said, 'It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.'"
The average age of the victims was 10.5 for girls and 11.5 for boys.' - from the Commission's statistics as reported by the BBC  So much for the tired claim that this was mostly gay priests and their teen lovers.
Poor poor Ontario. I feel for you. What a serious deficit of leadership this province has endured for decades. The spiral downwards continues.
How can a Twit explain any-thing?
Why isn't the United States sanctioning Saudi Arabia that does not even have a constitution. Saudi Arabia has only the Quran and laws that encourage child rape while severly punishing people  for reading the Christian BIble? So much hypocrisy!
"Sarah,  Very articulate article; well written, incisive, well supported, thoughtful.   Without the usual tabloid pseudo-english and irrelevant anecdotes. Whether you agree with trans-people being in the military or not; it is just another example of Trump's M.O.: find a minority, pick on them."

"No, I am perfectly correct. Paprocki's statement shows fear and loathing of gays. Pandora supports Paprocki's statement. Pandora ALWAYS supports conservative bishops when they are criticized -- always.   Once again, I speak the facts that Pandora would like to brush off."
Good for our PM.  The apology is long overdue and if the Pope has any morals he will apologize and beg forgiveness for the terror and horrific abuses inflicted on innocent children by the Catholic church.
"What??? The Germans didn't fight to create the 'master race'?  They didn't kill Jews, Gypsies, etc. because they believed that white Germans were the master race?  Where did you get your education? From Nazi propaganda publications?"

I'm really worried about his last two:  Two women (one of whom is Native American) and a black!  That is ominous!  And he wants his Jewish son-in-law to have a major role in his administration!   If Hillary appointed that ethnicity. there would be balloons and champagne!
"Some of what you write is not true. You can advocate, your directors can advocate your members can advocate. Individually they can go to a town meeting and speak out and mention which group they belong to."

BURKE - the face of Roman Catholic Fascism!
Throughout Latin America there is little or nothing for Catholics to apostatize FROM.
"The church hesitates to expose its criminal priests because it fears its enemies would exploit the situation'; so instead the institutional Church covers the crimes up, not understanding that it will look worse when the crimes are found out."
"In his pre-cardinal days, Burke was an arrogant, imperious and tyrannical despot. Oh, he's sweet, smarmy and so pious, bedecked in splendor at his Tridentine recreations, but he loves power. He's running for pope as we speak. Simply put, he wants the pope dead...or at least destroyed."
Islamic Terrorism is entrenched in the Muslim communities  of Canada and spreading with rich funding through mosques.  But Shhhh... don't talk about it.
You appear to have the same damn mentality that the  German people had when Hitler murdered six million Jews and Polish people; buried their heads so only their butt was sticking out.
"Support for traditional families, community and Christian values. Not something you see much of here in Canada lately."
Seems a bit early for a gay pride parade?
Your comment makes sense if you ignore the mainstream Republican view of the LGBTQ community and if you dismiss the anti-transgender legislation proposed and enacted by them.
"Dont feign ignorance, you are casting the state of Israel in a bad light intentionally, so know what I mean.  Anti-Semetic means anti Jewish, dont feign ignorance on one post and talk about your amazing grades in another...."
Can we stop with this nonsense of who the middle class is and just assess both plans on their merits.
And yet over 60% of Catholics voted for this hateful clown.  Why?
The Holy Spirit selects the Pope. The Pope must be listened to. Except I don't like this Pope and what he's teaching. The Holy Spirit obviously doesn't choose the Pope after all.
How about you get your facts straight. Vancouver does not pump raw sewage into the environment.

"Look up the word 'purport' JB, clearly you don't know what it means or have the ability to read my full sentence. You either have an amazing ability to hear exactly what you want to hear, or you are incredibly intellectually dishonest."
"Yeah, transgenders stay up all night plotting and planning about how they're going to assault unsuspecting citizenry.  Transphobia won't be the new normal.  The US Supreme Court put that nail in homophobia and transphobia."
"For most people against this, the issue is not transgenders.  The issue is perverts pretending to be transgenders so they can go into bathrooms with members of the opposite sex, especially children."
Science has no place in a Wente rant.
"Health care is a fat cow that must be trimmed constantly. The feds will force that, which is a good thing."
I never 'gave up' on 'opposite relationships'. I knew I was gay from the time I was 11 years old. It was not a 'choice'. The ignorance you assert here is simply unacceptable.
Its nice to see Trump focus on Islamic terrorists instead of treating the American People as the #1 threat like Obama did.
people created as gay by God in the first trimester of gestation'.   Can you provide any scientific evidence to support this claim?
this will trigger another wave of jewish suicide bombers on the world...
You think talking about romantic relationships are synonymous with sex and oral sex? So I'm assuming that Christians that wait to have sex until they are married aren't in a romantic relationship until they're married? Your ignorance is truly undeniable.
"LotL has a bogus theory about the transgendered, which he presents with NOTHING to support it."
"According to the left America is a racist and homophobic land where success is guaranteed if you are a white, Christian, heterosexual male but otherwise you'll slave away for starvation wages. I'm surprised these people would want to come here. I guess they haven't gotten the message yet."
"115 House Dems want proof Trump coordinated transgender military ban with Pentagon'  Meanwhile, the rest of the country wants Dems to stop mindless obstruction and do something positive for the country but they refuse.  Why is that?"
It is absolutely stunning to the point of journalistic malpractice that this isn't acknowledged.  It does predate Islam and is possibly pagan in origin.  To claim it as Islamic is to do no less than categorize Islam as a cargo cult.
"Umm, they were both Muslim terrorists no? Just sayin.."
I was banned from FB for a month because I dared to associate Palestinian students  burning the flag of Israel with Nazis burning books by Jewish authors. As far as I am concerned they are the same thing.
Tranny rights are human rights and human rights are tranny rights!  LOL. Just F kidding.
why is it that you hate jews so much?
And the Danes are known as the happiest folks in the world because you don't live there.
gawd... you again. how many times have you posted your pathetic petition this time?
I never respond to you on principle but I must correct the notion that there is any more 'sex' at a Gay Pride than there is at Mardi Gras. Kids attend. Our prime minister attends several across the country and takes his kids. You're full of it.
Wow--conversion therapy.  How sad that Mr. Gabriel is so woefully uninformed about this issue. Perhaps he is unaware of the suicide rate among young people who identify as transgender? Or the need for support of what is definitely not a lifestyle choice among teens? Makes me sad.
I was amused to note how long it took for Ontario to admit a woman to the bar after ruling that Jews could become lawyers- 60 years! And that she would be a rabidly anti-Semitic woman at that plates the irony with gold.
"Coren's position has been the official position of the Church since Vatican II (which incidentally John TOry copied in his ill fated electoral campaign), so its no surprise."
There is no “transgender”; that is a sick libtard construct.  There is only male and female:  all else is mistake of nature or freak!
Classic Zio lies. '...the caller ID made it seem as if the call was coming from our own office...' Im sure it did.   Nobody is calling Jews with bomb threats folks. Pathetic.
I'm not really sure there was a transgender policy 50 years ago. That would be 1967?
The Japanese do not want to destroy their country and culture to an invasion of colonists who consume but do not provoke anything for themselves or society.
"The Canadain government supports Islamic terrorism, their leadership is not a reliable ally."
Nothing is stopping the florist from exercising her freedom of speech by putting a hugh sign in her window 'WE DON'T SERVE GAY WEDDINGS' - why doesn't she?
"well gee, I guess I'm just all confused, and here I thought the UN gave Israel to the Jews."
ya buddy... its those cats.... its not the pollution or the chemicals.. its the cats..
It seems to me  transgender is faulty wiring in the brain bordering psychosis of people that are otherwise healthy. a weirdness just like fetischism .
Talk to people in UK whose way of life is being changed. Young girls being raped. Cities being taken over by muslims with their sharia law.  Young girls sexually mutilated. Married at 6 years of age to an old pervert. Feel sick talking about these animals.
"Take it from me (a bi guy who prefers men to women) not in a million years.  Like a straight guy once said, 'if gays want to get married and be miserable like the rest of us, then go for it.'  To me, that sums it up."
"Shaista,  you might get less push back if you were also prepared to talk about and acknowledge the existence of radical Islamist terror, jihadists, and the role of radical clerics who manipulate and create these young terrorists."
Why fo gay guys always think they can get away with misogyny?
"Tip:  Better to just use emojis to make your point, like DonfromKansas.   That's progressive Catholic rhetoric at its finest."
If we really want to honour the fallen. Give the money to veterans who are not getting it from the federal government or adds and lobbying to get the government to live up to it's responsibilities
Quebec can do what they want. I support them.
The whole ridiculousness of Transgender Sex is obviously here!
Muslims are obligated to implement Allah's orders to fulfil an Islamic State. The Quran states that it is not permissible to choose.
God bless you.
oh perk up at least now you can use a transgendered bathroom.
You should be poisoned and murdered. 
True political leadership is admitting you took a bribe.
Real problems are too difficult... Next up...transsexual perverts in the Washroom!
"Dana, you asked whether or not these women at the SF airport would have made similar comments about veiled Muslim women. I think they would. Bigotry and prejudice knows no boundaries when it involves any person described as 'other' than one's self."
That Trump is patholigical is not news. Nor is it news that EWTN and National Catholic Register put party above sanity.  It is amazing that the Vatican is now more progressive than the Alt-Right Catholic media.
Before you spot off about discrimination you should ask if they voted against having a cemetery  next door to them or against a Muslim cemetery .  You don't know and neither does anyone else.
If the Mayor says that he has gay friends - I'd bet dollars to donuts they are involved in the drug trade.
Kinda like the Westboro Baptist folks who protest gay everything - by showing up at every gay function imaginable.
"Do you know what 'transgender' means? It's not 'in between male and female', it's going from one to the other.  I see you did not address the fear and loathing towards our LGBT neighbors expressed by the society."
"when dose the homeless jew get a grant for a month in a motlele??????$1,500....puts the homeless jew into a motlele for a month"
They probably trying to escape hungry Muslims hiding in the woods.   LOL
the only TGs trump wants in the military are those Moscow trannies in the hitler youth outfits who pissed on him in his hotel room
Hagiography ....HA !!Too funny.
"Rogue Catholic knows, he just knows, that the Spanish tragedy was perpetrated by 'brown skinned people.' Disgusting."
No. Just anti-Russian. Not anti- Jews.
Read up on the facts concerning Abuses of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program & current investigations in the Food Industry; Educate oneself to the facts instead of swallowing this half-baked Opinion G&M gaseous-fluff -- wholesale...
What is Jewish response Bernie??   Oy Vey!!!
"Transgenderism is an arbitrary sex change, a lifestyle enabled by modern medicine."
This is a major problem with diversity.  It mandates that everyone needs to be special.  Special groups now need their unique culture and issues protected.  This leads to constant friction between al the special groups. Even the gay community has become fractured.
Sorry for all the facts upsetting your bull...
In your effort to balance gender you have given up competency.'I'd love your take on which ministers you believe are 'not competent'. This cabinet is filled with competent and talented people.
"You're right. Some of them are Republicans. (Sorry, couldn't help it!) I was referring to the rant: 'Agirlwhoknowsherownmind To put it bluntly, the war on Christmas has been led by Jewish organizations, financed by Jewish financiers.....' The condensed version would be: 'Jesus. The Reason for the Season'"
"He's a horrible man with his hate propaganda against homosexuals and his association with that portable toilet, the Poo Tin."
Wow. Jews really do get blamed for everything.
"He may have attended Robert E. Lee High. He thinks it's free speech only if one can get away with yelling' Kill the Jews and Blacks'. If you yell ' Kill the Nazis and White Supremacists', that's not protected by free speech."
I can't stand the orange man; can't see why any of you idiots (who also voted for bush/cheney) voted for him;  but I'm thankful he started his speech tonight condemning the violence against Jews across the nation.
Since when the US government has as priority to defend and expand the homosexual agenda? Why the state dept. take side with a nazi corrupted man like Soros? Nobody need to be a genious to know the answer.
The Old Testament is also a Christian holy book.
Because it undermines some racist tendencies.  He hates Jews.  Then he discovers that he has genetic markers for being partially Jewish.  Now what?
His birthright is Canadian and should we remove anyone's citizenship due to the actions of the parents or vice versa then we would be deporting entire families of muslims where one has been involved with ISIS or other terrorist acts.
I just about choked when i saw this headline! Walk through any campus and you see rich diversity on display everywhere. Then my second thought was how do you compile stats on gender at a time when so many identify as transgendered?
"This is the best comment I've read on a fairly obnoxious article re-hashing equally obnoxious, condescending media drivel about men and all their flaws (imagine if you can an article in the Globe focused on women and all their inadequacies).  Never been a better time to be gay."
A Church that refuses to accept women as priests will also negate gay priests. Misogyny is a sin.
TO's BML should be marching in Nigeria's gay pride next year under the Boko  Haram vail where most of their leadership's birthplace originates from.
"But there is evidence that Judge supported same-sex acts by self-identifying as 'gay,' as opposed to one who has same-sex attraction, which does not imply any opinion on same-sex acts.'  And your evidence to support this conclusion is what?"
How long have you been Gay?
The inerrant word of our saviour. With all of his infinite wisdom. Praise The Lord.
"Shisaisama, you're back! Did you imagine that Jesus asked you to go back on Civil Beat to blaggard gay people again?"
Good. Russia votes for a clearly anti-Israel resolution that serves to contribute to anti-Semitic sentiment and further attacks on and stabbings of innocent Israeli Jews by Palestinians.  Karma is right.
And now you see how the right wing uses the term political correctness to label their enemies.
"I think the left actually wants to characterize most of the Catholic moral teaching as having to do with sexuality.'  Really, R.D.?  When I ever hear some self-described 'orthodox' Catholic talk about morality, it is always sexual morality."
All fine and dandy until a wanted psychopath gets dressed up or decided he is transgender and kills someone.You should be identified by your birth name for security reasons.WHY are these mentally ill people getting preferred treatment like Black Lives Matter and left wing nuts in general?
A 'fascist' has a Jewish son-in-law?  Black members of his administration?  Supports Israel?  What am I missing here?
attempt suicide or commit suicide?  I think the 43% would be the % of trans people who attempt it.
"7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.' Any other questions?"
"Sure, because 'very fine people' march with nazis and white supremacists carrying torches, chanting 'we will not be replaced by jews!'"
Why not call hm what he is - a white christian terrorist?
Make America Gay Again'?  When were we ever a gay nation?
"The 32% of deplorables still adore him, and the evangelicals think he’s the second coming of JC, lol"
"Really, R.D.?  So white racism doesn't exist?  Did you happen to notice that white supremacist rally in Charlottesville.  Also, if priestly sex abuse never happens, how come the Catholic Church is paying out billions of $ in settlements to victims?"
"That is very, very not smart. Illegal invaders are not a protected class.  Gays are a part of a protected class in Colorado, but that does not mean they are afforded extra rights, that is silly. If this were a test you would have failed."
Christ said give unto Cesar what is Caesar's. Pay your taxes like the rest of us suckers.
Aspirational self-identified gender? Griping about how two marginalized populations i.e. Native Hawaiians and transgender individuals tick the boxes sounds like you are an intolerant racist white male. You are a petty man.
Amazing indeed. She worked in the US illegally as a model and lied about it on her visa application. She lied about her university degree. She plagiarized her convention speech. She posed nude in lesbian themed soft-porn pix. Real classy. http://nypost.com/2016/08/01/melania-trumps-girl-on-girl-photos-from-racy-shoot-revealed/
"If the Jews are eliminated, then the Nazis are OK (?)"
Catholic trolls...who knew?
"Reagan a hero, hahahahaha, it is people like you who aided trumps win."
"Sask. corruption hmmm & half of Devines cabinet thrown in jail... but yeah, Montreal & Toronto got big problems... glad I'm here in Vanc."
"Oh, please, another 'back in my day' story. Did you have to walk 2 hours a day to get t school too? The kids are alright."
"Your islamophobic statement has been reported under M-103.  Referring to your Muslim brothers and sisters as 'suckers', in light of the recent attack, is not only intolerant, but it is hateful.  Don't you respect all faiths, or is it just one?"
"I summarized from the book and you were unsatisfied, therefore I directed you to the source, which by the way, won the freaking Pulitzer Prize.  Trad historiography: if history is unflattering to the Catholic Church, the historian is therefore anti-Catholic.  I can't take you seriously."
MINSHALL  i think a JEW would be a better assemblyman than you !
They could be transgender. I am so funny.
"Pride in publishing dissent, heteroxy , attacks on teachings and faithful Catholics. Yes truly a great legacy and so exemplary of Jesuit inspired false spirit if VII 'catholicism'"
Throw in a couple scenes of female genital mutilation and you have a ' How to Behave ' documentary for Muslim dominated countries.
"Probably not the first time.' Speculation is not proof. I see nobody claiming that being Jewish confers any sort of free pass. On the contrary, there is a consensus that he said a stupid thing. There is not consensus, though, on whether this was a firing offence or not."
"Well, the whole of the CI (Catholic Institution) start from Pope F., the Vatican prelates, Bishops are weeds, it needs to be plow under.  Any one rooted in Christ will flower after the plow since nothing can destroy the one who loves God."
Not true at all they would actually be guaranteed a strong permanent voice since they always get a good 30% of support
robert reich is a sawed off stubby with an inferior complex that is a mile deep he is what the DNC palms off as an intellectual reich is a pig-me-me-me as the Jews would say - unclean goes bone deep
Thank you. The vast majority of people are very supportive of the real transgender community..although there is concern about some issues eg Caster Semenya running as a female. But they do NOT support genital mutilation for those with no chromosomal abnormalities.
Every member of the USCCB should be strapped to a lie detector at their next meeting and asked if they are a homosexual.
"Ok, so there are diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria which are not meet by simply being transgender. No one asked for, and no one cares what your personal opinions are."
"All forms of racism must be eliminated, forms of Islamophobia, Anti-Semitism, Homophobia and discrimination against transgenders. People need to support Justin, Obama, Hillary and Premier Wynne in this fight against evil."
Attempts to go along have never panned out well for Israel.  Jewish intolerance?  LOL
Civil marriage is NOT a religious thing. Not one syllable of 'God-talk' is required to be civilly married. Religionism poisons everything it touches.
You are being really fucking nasty about this
The Brits won't learn until it's to late.   Gotta get ride of all those Muslims.
"Khan and co knew the place was a rathole and firetrap for years but did nothing about it.  Shows Khan's true colors, most of those living there were poor muslims. Khan is just another champaign socialist"
"So, deny payments for the surgery if he's that upset over something that would amount to one one-hundredth of one percent of the Defense budget. But don't kick all transgender people out of the military. You're a perfect example of Trump's famous 'Fifth Avenue' quote."
"Depends. The churches enjoy tax-exempt status and are therefore subsidized by all of us. They're ripe for human rights complaints and lawsuits, I say. Discriminate against gays and women in Canada in 2017--because your magic stories declare them sinners or inferiors--and you deservew what you get."
"And what did you cancel when Obama dropped tons of bombs on innocent Muslim civilians.....or when he invoked, by presidential order the termination of Iraqi civilian immigration?!"
"He is gay, so he's imminently qualified to hold the portfolio of Minister of Virtue-Signalling and Identity Politics."
@progressive: those aren't the average schools though. the average american education experiance is CRAP. even the Americans admit it
"from the Business Insider:  A 2016 study by the Rand Corporation found the maximum annual medical costs for transgender services would be around $8.4 million. By comparison, the military spent $84 million on erectile dysfunction medications such as Viagra and Cialis in 2014, the Military Times reported.    http://www.businessinsider.com/pentagon-transgender-medical-comparison-2017-7"
"Seems to me that the violence in Turkey has rapidly escalated since the anti secular, pro fundamentalist  Erdogen took office.  Could there be a link between violence and fundamentalist Islam?"
I am totally shocked and deeply disturbed that abuse of minors is still happening in the Catholic Church. Are you? If you are not shocked and disturbed then you are part of the problem.
"I mean, obviously... basketball players are taller than average"
"Yea, but is she going to toe the party line and promote transgendered, sexual dysphoria to our first graders?"
"Your bathroom? Are trans people coming into you house and using YOUR bathroom? I thought we were talking about PUBLIC bathrooms, which by definition are for the PUBLIC, not for your personal and exclusive use."
"Let's be clear- Transgender Justin and Gerald Take-it-up-the-Butts don't care about asylum seekers, international borders, human rights, overtaxed Canadians or anything other than staying popular and staying elected.   It's pure smoke, mirrors, selfies & 3x weekly hair salon visits."
Since he presumably honors his public vow of celibacy what difference would it make if he were gay?
...............celebrate the birth of the god Mithras (or the new sun).
"People can't join with psoriasis but lets reset all medical, physical training, tactical and operational standards for a transgender?'  I haven't seen anyone, not in these comments or anywhere else, propose that. Reset standards for transgendered? That's your straw man. Logic fail."
"So, what does all that have to do with transgender?"
I agree entirely which is why Christians who claim to be patriots are liars.
"If you are implying  that the pope approves of transgender ideology, yes I do have a problem with your comment."
Pride Parade will. Santa is gay in the new Progressive world. Get with the times.
Funny thing is: Most of the populist movements in Europe are headed or supported by Catholics.   I guess the pope doesn't want to mingle with and smell like his sheep.   Hypocritical?   Yes.
When is the homeless Jew going some grant money?????
Keep in mind that medical personnel have families too. They work hard all year and want to enjoy some family time as well.
Breitbart? I bypass to snopes.  https://www.snopes.com/miguel-martinez-transgender-bathroom-controversy/
"Democracy includes protection of minority rights. After all, the Nazis had the mandate of the majority to persecute the Jews."
Gender neutral EH. What is the point of photo ID if does not have gender and allows transgender cross dressing.
Christianity had a reformation? When did that happen exactly? And tieing atheist to communism is pure nonsense.
"Now that is persecution, not telling a farmer he is not welcome at a market because he opposes gay civil marriage for religious reasons."
"Thank you, bookmark... will spread... Cheers Miles,"
Need a citation that Muslim terrorists are still being allowed to enter the country. Do you mean like that girls science team from Afghanistan for whom Trump told his administration to overrule the Muslim travel ban?
There is no Muslim cemetery in Quebec.
You are a re-take on the movie 'I'm All Right Jack.'
"You are right, of course. Some Pharisees were indeed friends of Jesus, but most weren't. In fact, they repeatedly conspired with the Saducees to entrap Jesus, make him look a disobedient fool, and, ultimately, to have him executed. Hence the pejorative use of the word 'Pharisee'."
"Oh, we're back on the Russia thing again?  What happened to Trump being a white supremacist, having a Jewish son-in-law, a convert daughter, and Jewish grandchildren?  Oh, and a black friend named Dr. Ben Carson."
"Yeah, he'll put the UN in its place, just like he'll ban travel from Muslim countries and revoke Obamacare?"
Give them a big Liberal hug and free heroin every day and they won't want to hurt other people
The Globe buries every article that is critical of the Liberals. It moves from the front page to hidden corners before noon.
"Comparing someone to Trump ,like its a bad thing. Globe and mail is home to so much entitled cucks."
So then who made homosexuals? We are taught that God made us all.
Easy. The transgendered don't know who to molest.
inappropriate parties... this is a joke. I'll take my God to a more suitable location for my gay wedding.
"Parasites.'  The word Hitler used over and over to describe Jews. Any time you find yourself speaking of other human beings in those terms, you need to back up and figure out where you went wrong.  Trump is unable to do that, but most normal people can."
...but they're not in the Constitution. And which of those Judeo-Christian principles do you suppose compelled those good Christians to slaughter and persecute all those Native Anericans while expanding the empire?
"I lost interest when i read the word, 'Muslim'."
You don't even realize how stupid your comment is ---- do you? LOL You are clueless about who the indictments were for or you would not have made the comment you did.
Leftist ideology gave women the vote. It also gave minorities the vote. Rightwing ideology backed segregation. It opposed gay marriage. It backed slavery.  Scheer is finished before he started.
"You don't know what you're talking about, whatever-your-name-for-the-day is. You can't stay on point and have no understanding of scripture or history, and certainly no understanding of Judaism. So forgive me if I prefer what I learned in Rome to what you're trying to pass off here. Bye."
So? Islam has been encroaching on and invading Europe since the 7th century.  There can be no peace until Constantinople is returned to Christendom .   REMEMBER 1453 AND THE GOLDEN HORN:  NIL IUSTE  NIX PACE
Does that mean Jews are cannibals?
a lot of big words there professor. stick with your textbooks and living off the public dole.

Really?  And I suppose if your child is sexually abused by a priest/clergy member/preacher then it is all fine because the abuser is 'Christian'?  Grow up and start thinking.
But Trudeau is dancing pretty in Paris. Nevermind the taxes.

"No, we don't have a problem. We have the First Amendment. I didn't mention your religion. You are free to celebrate gay marriage."
Harvey as a name really sets off my gaydar.
Look at the guy in the picture who didn't doff his cap.  Someone should have knocked it off.  Or maybe he's just not a good Christian.
"Don't set yourself up as being so special. Evangelical, Anglican, Presbyterian, Catholic, Muslim, Hindu, Shamanism, Buddhist, Sun Worshipers and Kardashian Fans. It makes no difference. They are all equally worthless."

Wise observation waynes2.  Joshua Boyle may be another untrustworthy Islamic presence in Canada.
Thank you Barry. A comment from someone with actual experience and therefore credibility. I'm assuming if a female-in arms sacrificed their life or body part for you or another male colleague(s) on the field she would be respected like any other.
Show some grace Globe... I'm paying you $20/month---I think you owe and other readers the courtesy of a serious thoughtful refection on what your support has done.
"@ Expectation ManagerYour compassion and understanding is truly underwhelming. I hope you never find yourself needing support from the state if your circumstances change for the worse, or you become dependent in your old age."
but he's jewish right?  that must matter to some degree
"In typical Globe and Mail fashion, nobody takes credit for this piece of crap article. Whitey is very afraid, and rightly so."
"The baker should just put a sign out front that says, 'We refuse to serve gays for religious reasons.'  He should move to a state where it is legal to discriminate against gays."
Kenai assembly! Denounce your false Jewish man-god and accept Cthulhu as your dark savior! Only through Him can you escape this silly position in which you have put yourself. Repent of your godly works and your sins will be justified forevermore.
I love the ultra-christian right winger standing in a gas chamber warning us about ultra right wing christians from Europe some 70 odd years ago in order to advance his re-election efforts.  Hypocrtie.  Coward.
It's time to hit pause on immigration and direct all efforts and funds towards those in THIS country who desperately need support.
Greetings......Being a Christian I cannot really in all good conscience feel that voting for either Clinton or Trump is morally ethical. Clinton is not a  caring progressive as she says....but a Pro Choice Republican and Trump is off the charts as a greedy Narcisstic Fascist
"Bad ideas should be mocked and ridiculed because, otherwise, they tend to infect later generations. That's why we have Christians today."
"I don't understand the 'racial component' comment.   Whites split their votes more than any other race.  Hispanics, blacks, Jews, Asians all vote more racially, and more racially cohesive, than whites to.  Why isn't this ever criticized?   A:  hypocrisy."

"Hang on, let's not to be to hasty, we still have some groups, transgender for example, that need to be in cabinet, experience and know how will just have to wait."
What attitude would that be now? The one about traitors? Or the one about a traitor suddenly becoming transgender to escape a full prison sentence?
"False, they have no sees to teach in or minister to.  They are now just old Catholic guys.  Their opinions are as valid as yours and mine."
"‘I assure you, as often as you did it for one of my least brothers, you did it for me.’ (Mat 25:40)   God weeps because the Catholic clergies rape him in Children!!!!!!!!!!! I can't understand how on earth clergies do not know this!"
"You have to remember that to Tridentinus, any Catholic who disagrees with HIM on anything is a heretic. Trid is extremely arrogant in his belief that he and only he represents orthodoxy."
What if Jesus were bisexual as a hermaphrodite?  Would that make a difference? Is being a woman less human than being a man? (St. Thomas said a woman was an 'ill-made man.'
I see they have Jews doing damage control
"If a pedophile is male and abuses a boy, why is he not gay?  I never have understood that.  When the lgbt want gay leaders in the boy scouts and then beat up the boy scouts when a male abuses one of the boys."
"You have no citations for your comments, so there is no reason to believe them, but there was a nice article stating that we spend more on Viagra fro servicemen than we would ever spend on gender reassignment.  Admit it, transgendered people just scare you."
The Catechism is wrong.
"Initially, the Nazis too wanted to send the Jews out of Europe. The Final Solution was proposed later.  And providing smallpox infected blankets to the natives does suggest genocidal plans, knowing that they had no cure for that terrible disease."
This is illogical thinking.  Viagra costs (which should be paid by the individual) are spread across the millions ho serve.  Sex change drugs would apply only to the tiny minority who are 'trans'  -- so naturally the Viagra cost would be far greater.
"This story highlights what I've know for years, 'christians' are totally screwed in the head and need to be fought at every turn.  They can't even protect THEIR OWN DAUGHTER ... from this 'religious' monster.  Yikes!!!"
you are saying that the Jews will be responsible for a future genocide that will exterminate them.  interesting that the Globe watchdogs feels this comment is within their bounds of civility.
Yes...the Democrats made the neo-Nazis rally.... Just like the Jews made Hitler invade Poland.....it wasn't racial hatred...really... The Democrats made that boy run over those people and kill that girl.... The Democrats made Mr. Trump condone the behavior.... Darn Democrats...
There's nothing wrong with birds of a feather flocking together unless you're white - this is a big no-no. Complaints about lack of diversity etc will be cried out at the drop of a hat.
now we got some jap guy who thinks trump is hitler? good god people stop the drama please. trump wants to kick out bomb throwing muslims. real americans are all for it. get on board or get run over.
We can form the world's only predominately gay nation and Trudeau will have a majority government forever.
I can't imagine a transgender female going in to a men's restroom.
VanMorty - that's because all your friends are on these G&M web- boards. Try talking to people and you'll see there's a lot of support for Enbridge and our energy producers generally than you'd ever guess reading this columnist.
"Yup.... that's right. Go after the successful people. You know..... the ones that build large companies that create jobs, pay for peoples' mortgages and kids' educations. What did the Beatles do when their tax rate reached over 90%...... they moved (along with their record label).... to the USA. Think it through, folks!"
All speculation designed to convince the gullible that homosexual behaviour is perfectly normal and natural.
Fanatics'?  'Lunatics who hate Christians and conservatives'?  Rather strong words to describe those who believe that personal freedoms as long as they do no harm to others should be preserved and that corporations should not have equal standing with citizens.
"Agirl:  SORRY, I just can NOT accept the Catholic organization because of their Raping  Priests.  Look at the Magnitude of Mental Anguish that they INFLICT on their Victims, and these Victims are messed up the rest of their lives.  Same with the Boy Scoundrel Scouts........."
Alleviate the suffering the best you can. That's what most Canadians want.
Ya sure but does he renounce Allah and Muslims now who want your neck ? Can you get that he wanted to kill you and  does he now according to the Quran?
There should be a law for posting on the internet the same as driving a car. If I have to read another one of these uninformed posts from a naive 15 year old on their lunch break I'd go ask my neice. 
He's the kind of pervert we have to worry about in our kids bathroom not transgender folks
You mean 'The Sociopathic Business Party'.But religion is just one of their crowd control techniques.
 Muslims are being harassed and assaulted in the streets. '  Source?
A vacuous comment from a simple mind.
And of course the same rules should apply to the unions. i am sure you agree..
"Once a lower court legally recognizes a transgender petitioning for a legal name and sex change, there's nothing anyone can do about it (i.e. Chasity Bono and Bruce Jenner).  Try and stop either of these people from using a public access shower or bathroom."
"We hope Lazeelink that the 4 people are literate enough to ""get"" her message even if it's entirely out of place this Canada Day :) Maybe those four will tip you better too when they return for a visit!"
Last time I checked diabetes was an illness. Are you suggesting that transgenderism is also an illness?
What a perfectly 'christian' thing to do ... more of the SAME Fear and Loathing from 'christian' Republicans.
I'm sure all the Good Christian people of Alabama will be clutching their pearls in Outrage over Dump's use of foul un-Jesusy language.  Whatever Will We Tell The Children
"How do your comments apply to Muslims. I know many and they are not interested at all in 'taking over the world.' What nonsense you spout. Get an education and then make some Muslim friends. You're the problem, not the solution."
Public affairs are secular. Period.
"Dude, this is just a math problem lol. Literally 7800. Did it under 10 seconds. Do you not learn math in school anymore? Is this why the millennials are complaining life is so hard? Let me guess, math was racist so it got replaced with gender studies?"
No Catholic is obliged to answer a call to violence even if uttered by one of the Church’s bishops.
"Agreed. I think Colorado is open-minded enough to elect a gay politician, but I'm not sure. Might depend on whether the GOP nominates a moderate. Knowing them, they might nominate someone who was against same sex marriage."
A gender based tax policy? Sounds very complicated and very unfair. And what about transgendered? This is just another can of worms being opened.
"Alabama is not a state known for producing intellectuals, but rather clueless Christian conservatives like Sessions."
I can't see why.  Gay people are just as responsible as everyone else to pay the societal costs associated with unwanted pregnancies.  But I guess a hater gotta' hate.
You fell far short of making any excuse for the lack of values inherent in so-called 'christian' Republicans.
Transgender like the  traitor 'Chelsea' Manning who was  pardoned by Obama.
Well said as usual... simple compassion what a concept...
It is called following the constitution. Certain powers are federal and certain are provincial. Nowhere does it specify that the centre of the universe is Toronto.
I wonder why?  Answer:  Because AIPAC likes it when they bomb Muslims.
"As somebody else pointed out, the Danes also have one of the highest rates of suicide. Bash religion all you want, but you have to admit it gives people purpose in life."
Trump announces ban on transgender people serving in U.S. military'  How is that biased?
"Homosexual is now gay,' And, gay people are out of the closet! They're in the military! Run for your life!"
"The new law, which ludicrously requires transgender people to use the restroom consistent with the sex on their birth certificates,'  Yeah, how dare we ask people to use the bathroom that fits their sex !!  How 'ludicrous' !"
"If the media had done its job of fairly criticizing both candidates, Trump's shorthand exaggerations would not have been necessary to get his points across."
If that was the case every one would claim they were a conscientious objector and get a draft deferral. And since that didn't happen it wouldn't happen to claim you were 'transgender' and get a deferral either.
"They also predominantly marry relatives in Egypt, often first cousins. This has negative results for the population."
"Do notice the assumption of gender differences.  How will this article read after a decade of same-sex marriage?  Oh, to heck with natural law.  We are too smart for our own good."
"The holohoax (sic) didn't happen, but the holocaust, in which the NAZI's gassed, starved and shot 6 million Jews did indeed happen. You can admit this irrefutable truth and still be proud of your German heritage, Mr. Groth."
"Lock her up until Trump resigns. The charge: An accomplice in crimes against humanity, denial of health care, anti transgender and no regard for refugees."
"By comparing Trump to Hitler, you cheapen the death of 6 million Jews/5 million non Jews."
He was shouting God's name as he killed which is common for Islamic terrorists.. That might indicate his motivation
If Cosby was Muslim the comments would be closed   ;)
"What's up, Doc? Don't forget the shemozzle at Red River College in Winnipeg. Nyaaah, what a maroon!"
To R W Ranked ballot - second choice do you think Conservatives and NDP are so dumb as to give Second Choice to the Liberals Strategic voting they will give Second choice to smaller parties like Green etc ABL = anybody buy Liberals
thoughs and prayers - yeah that'll save a lot of lives
Thank God I am gay and dont have to deal with women.
I didn't know Donald Trump is transgendered!
Great work on the part of the Arcy MP! Great timing! I'm thrilled to know that our law enforcement officers support Adolph Harper's overthrow of what I once thought was an ideal country. The ideologues have us!
"One of the loveliest ironies of this is that according to most historians, Tchaikovsky was gay. And we know how Russia treats its gay citizens, don't we?"
"As it always has been, the issue us the voluntary act, not the involuntary attraction.  'Gay' means same-sex attraction AND the unrepentant acceptance of engaging in sodomy.  So, when you 'tell' someone that you're 'gay,' you are telling them both things."
The non-progressive side never deserves even minimal respect.' Sure. And calling the author silly and an idiot shows a lot of respect for her views too.
"Thank you for your courage, and for the beautiful article. The thoughts and prayers of millions of people around the world are with you."
"I agree that he probably didn't mean it as it sounded, but it definitely sounded as though he meant that guns would solve the problem."
Only until he got elected.
Most advocates will be lesbians.
"So Bush, Clinton and Obama became president because the nation is as you described top heavy with fake Christians etc. etc. etc.?"
Ronster People are strongly affected by propaganda. Germans became killers of Jews through propaganda. Canadians have become killers of Canadians through propaganda.
The solicitors general should have to tell the police that they are supposed to enforce the law. They should know it already.
It seems it's OK when it's a Democrat doing the deed.
"So Chinese people are the best judges of human rights for all of humanity? That is what you are saying, which is, of course absurdly arrogant and ignorant. You do know what human rights actually entail, right? Right?"
we dont need transphobic left wing fanatics here. thanks.
"Not here for a semantics debate, especially when the meanings and connotations of words change rather quickly nowadays.  Hope you have a gay day."
The Evangelicals hang on to Trump and Playboy disowns him.  That about says it for the Christian integrity of this current group of Evangelical political prostitutes.
Because it isn't about a solution. It is about the death and destruction of the Jews. Next question.
What does that have to do with transgender people in the military?
How ignorant can these rainbows be?  Islam forbids homosexual acts under penalty of death.  These maroons want to support and protect their enemy.
Systemic racism' brought about by those who kill and main in the name of Islam and you don't understand why.
I think Margaret Wente did a wonderful job in pointing out how malicious feminists can be; and the need for a reasonable approach in dealing with this matter
Take care! Hope the best for you.
"You sir are, quite simply, wrong. Put your cracked pot away and join the 21st century. Science is not a hoax."
"moon howler missed the Globe's mini-article yesterday, in which it listed its own record of endorsing Conservatives at election times: 9 times out of 12 elections in the last 40 years, including 2011. That's some 'Liberal bias.'"
"Given that their father assisted a lunatic who baked Jews in gas chambers, I would guess not.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/koch-refinery-nazis_us_569e9870e4b00f3e9863266c  https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/us/politics/father-of-koch-brothers-helped-build-nazi-oil-refinery-book-says.html?_r=0  Not sure what about the above two facts is funny, but it appears that G&M threads are populated by a fair few sociopaths.  Wag the dog."
People like you.....'  So easy to tell the racists and sexists So what proof do you have that it was a 'transgender' that caused both ship accidents?
"No, Tridentinus.  I come here for reasonable discussion of the issues both ecclesiastic and non-eclessiastic.   If your idea for a reasonable discussion is that someone has to leave the Catholic Church if they don't agree with you, then you are a troll."
"Well, why doesn't the terrorist suspect hand himself in to police? Explain that one?  Of course his wallet would be either on himself or beside him while he committed his ISIS act of terror. Not too surprising either that the Islamist coward would flee the truck and forget his wallet."
"Since the apostles were all Jews, then gentiles cannot be ordained. That is EXACTLY the same argument as the one about the apostles being all men, therefore women cannot be ordained."
"Simply, why would the Liberals tie themselves to a sinking (NDBBQ) ship? The Liberals have far more upside, and the NDBBQ has only downside....come the next election.."
<<I am curious what I look like thru 'hairy eyeballs.'>>  It seems I wasn't explicit enough: You look like a Catholic fascist.  But I didn't mean to derail the thread by throwing out a bit of snark.
Young and bright....' are there no older homosexuals?
"The Chinese LOVE using the words co-operation and mutual trust. Believe me, I've done business with these folks and the co-operation and mutual trust only go one way. YOU co-operate and trust them, they will never extend the same courtesy to you."
"70,000 years'? How do you depict a transgender person with a cave drawing?"
Sample needs a remedial course in catholic moral theology.  SAD!
"Aspirin came from plants until it was isolated and put into medicinal form. What's your point? Digitalis is also deadly, hence the benefits from isolating it and controlling it purity, dosage, and usage."
"really?  Should we kick out the Jews, the Irish, the Italians, the Sikhs, and anyone else you don't like?"
Phew...and here I thought in 2017 that making fun of gays was wrong.  I guess the key is to be a progressive...
Nor is it okay for anyone to use the term ?you guys? (sexist).'Never mind the real world where groups of only women will use it in reference to each other.
Ultra-Orthodox Jews do not kill other Jews or Arabs and are not dangerous to anyone.
"Just so you know, it's possible for people of all races to be racist. There are racist Asians, blacks, whites, Jews, Hispanics, aboriginals, and east Indians."
Hmm..my remark was certainly not uncivil.    But I'll change it just a bit.  Using your logic then...no one gets to make that accusation unless one is homosexual? So...what does that mean about those who make the allegations?  That they must be homosexual?
Sure...right after the IRS investigates all those left-wing Negro ministers and left-wing Jew rabbis.
"Can you find the actual quotation, please? Because it was, in fact, an Israeli Prime Minister -- Itzhak Rabin -- who was assassinated by a Jewish-Israeli extremist for signing an agreement with the Palestinians."
Two questions: 1. Why Pope F. become a symbol of light instead of a pitch dark bottomless hole regarding clergy sex abuse of children? 2.  Is Pope F. consider as a Christian since he is hiding condoning his clergies rape children?
"Who exactly are 'these people' that you speak of?  Do you mean all Muslims?  If so, then stop hiding and come right out with your bigoted, ignorant and baseless views."
"The terrorists want a Christian right wing leader. It helps them recruit.   Their nightmare is the liberal, warm hearted and open minded leader. He makes it harder for them to recruit."
What's the difference between a Catholic Priest and a pimple? The pimple waits until after puberty before it comes on your face.
"Gay men are not pedofiles but if you're a man who preys on boys, you're gay and a pedofile.  The gay community can try to argue otherwise but that is the way it is."
"What a bigoted and discriminatory policy!  There is no mention at all of the trans-gendered, non-binary or 2-spirited in this policy.  Why is York U. openly discriminating against these groups?  Of course, I'm outraged."
"like the nazis: those that were considered 'lesser than' the ideal. in their case Jews, Roma, Africans, and Slavs, the mentally retarded, the imperfect. we can add the old, the sick, with socialized medicine."
"The Church shouldn't be ordaining anyone; that only confirms and feeds the clerical culture. Lay people -  female, male, trans, whoever -  should be empowered to preside at Mass. What makes an 'ordained' person any more worthy than anyone else?"
i know women who live in Toronto and they tell me the best looking and stable men are mostly Gay.
"@ Register-Guard, putting someone's name in triple parentheses is a white-supremacist means of targeting jewish people. It is hate speech. Please remove."
I wonder why the left continues to fight for allowing men in girls bathrooms and locker rooms? Seems strange behavior considering there are more pervs then transgenders.
"What Canadians 'feel' is not relevant to the 100, 000 Canadians who have died in WWI, WWII, and Korea, to name a few. THAT is history, not current 'feelings' by a few."
and Christians do?  Guess you have selective use for free speech.  Sad.
"For anyone who wants to help the transgender community fight intolerance, here's a GoFundMe campaign for an awesome nonprofit fighting the good fight:  https://www.gofundme.com/help-save-gender-justice-nevada"
Deviance at its best means abnormal. At its worst means sexually perverted and compulsive. Not words to use when talking about transgender people.  Delusion is thinking there are only straight boys and straight girls and anything else is somehow abnormal or 'less than'.
... ain't you Republicans all about restricting Freedoms and Liberties of others??!!  Ask a transgender VET to their faces.  Dare ya.
Transgender folks have always existed. It's just that most people are ignorant about it.
People claiming to be Christians are using our adopted religion to their evil benefit....
And we prosper.
"When Obama was in office, only 30% of white evangelicals would forgive a president's immoral behavior.   Now it's 72%.   https://t.co/c6FlHbziMi"
Unfounded.  Our military is not weakened by transgender people. Your example above is a fiction. Nobody is telling the military that they need to let anyone into any position regardless of performance.   You're insulting and dehumanizing people who are serving their country and it's sick.
"Leadership, PMZ, Ohhhh hahahahah.."
the government will make it illegal for a white man and a white women to breed as well the way it is going.   only question is will that come before the mandatory homosexuality laws.
"Or any of the Islamist countries that treat women like second class citizens, demanding absolute submission to male authority under the guise of religious piety."
Canada ranks as one of the worse countries when it comes to vacation time. Leave the banked sick days alone.
McMaster university won't be getting any donations from me after what happened to the trans language prof. Agree with him or not but don't prevent him from speaking
Jocabe...... it is about having a qualified leader for the opposition. He is dangerous having no resume for the job. Garneau was so accomplished and probably brilliant and the Liberals rejected him over pretty boy Justin with the name.
"Good grief, the thing has found an opening for its drool."
She is in the same line like her Grandfather! Granpda news said Russians and Jews were dirty animals and she still abhorres Russian. I don't know her feelings on Jews though.
"I would believe that he is against it. I am hoping that he will deal with it and that many, many bishops and priests will be asked to leave (or retire) and then I hope that they are arrested and tried and jailed. Let's watch him. Let's pray for him."
"Of course I wouldn't, but it wouldn't be because of transgender people; it would be because of a possible priest in there."
"I suppose you've never heard of the Security Council, or why membership is important. But go ahead and maintain your ignorance, as Harper would want you to do."
"Didn't Trudeau wag his finger and scold China,  Japan and Korea about how few women and transgendered persons are in the boardrooms of their national industries ?"
"Respect for people, not for ideologies."
"I am not supporting Zille's thoughtless remarks, but to me the author's analogy with her tweets to colonialism that 'today’s Jews benefited from scientific advances made during the Holocaust' is unsustainably idiotic."
"sylvia, All the Palestinians and Arabs had to do was not attacking Israel. Now the Jew-haters continue their terrorist tactics instead of negotiating. A topsy-turvy world, too difficult to research an issue when you can just ignore reality. Ever wonder how trump got in?"
Got screwed by the liberals more than once. They became the LIEBERALS.
"True sign of a cowardly bully is picking on weaker states while oozing out of office and never standing up to ISIS,terrorism,Communist China, and real issues.....bye... bye.... 'obummer'....Muslim plant,5th columnist,and worst President in U.S. history!"
Anyone who professes to be a christian and supports Donald Trump is both a hypocrite and an idiot.
"Bill C-51 threatens the rights of all Canadians, period."
That's a lot of words.   TL;DR version: I'm afraid my child will catch The Gay.
"Whew - good thing this orange-glazed cracker wasn't President when the Jews were fleeing the Nazis.   Although, the USA, like Canada, did turn away one ship of refugees."
Catholic Social Services and City Government created cesspool.
All parishes need to become 'social justice' parishes.   The attitude of the institutional hierarchy is painfully obvious. They are becoming more and more irrelevant by their pathetic response to such Christian activities to help our poor and marginalised.
"Leroy and Quinn,  look at her support from convicted felon Tom Anderson.  A guy who took bribes from a guy who was having sex with an under age Native Girl.  But hey,  they're both Christians, right?"
"We have not degraded the church as a moral guide, the church historically has degraded itself in horrific demented behavior. This is an excellent example; while white European Christians called us savages because of our gods, white PC liberals are calling us uncivil savages because of our mascots."
Americans don't ban Muslim women from wearing facial coverings. As far as I know it's not even on their radar. So why are Canadians so hyped up about it?
Bannon will go to war with people in Trump's circle that he sees as Globalists...and Jews. Get ready for a vicious cat fight on the right...grab the popcorn and watch the fur fly!
"Danica Roem, elected to Virginia’s House of Delegates, became Virginia’s first openly transgender elected official . . . '  The right and proper response from a society that deems itself gender identity enlightened is 'Yeah, yeah, nice.  Is 'Pawn Stars' new or a rerun tonight?'"
This article is a worthless rant... lets get on.
"The media, the Liberal party, and the Canadian public 'suddenly discovered compassion', in Trudeau's words, after seeing the boy's picture. Of course there is no limit until their sin is redeemed."
"Entirely anecdotal, but I've never had a bad experience in a public restroom. Ever. And to imply transgender people as perverted dudes in skirts is not accurate."
Other than one instance in Virginia all cases of vehicular mass murder are Muslim. But our media will never let us get over Vigina while never mentioning the full truth of the other 99.99999% of cases.
"The court does NOT create law - it just tells the politicians to rewrite the laws MORE CLEARLY. And they do and the system works - until some wing nut decides politicians should be dictators beholden to no outside scrutiny. Stupid move, wing nut!!"
but I thought this was about children. Does bullying mall boys with a 'low masculine quotient' make them any less likely to grow into active homosexuals? - unless it kills them.
"SayeSo Sayeth Martin, the Liberal uber-apologist.After the 'shock and awe' of Trump's victory, I'm surprised that he isn't still hiding in his 'safe space'....."

Thanks for your support.
"Well that settles it. All those scientists are wrong and HTexmes knows the truth. Thanks for letting us know. Perhaps you could have spoken up sooner and saved us a lot of angst, but at least now we know that there's nothing to this CO2 thing."
Wente's mistake. It was NOT the Israeli flag. It was a Star of David ( a Jewish not Israeli symbol ) on the Pride flag.
As is a trans women being a lesbian.
could of bot the homeless jew downtown a house with that money....but he wanted to be a big shot
"Some aside...you tell such outrageous lies and now it's, 'jews by some estimates killed more germans than germans killed jews.'. I find your posts to be mostly phony BS but this one is simply disgusting. 'Have you no decency, sir?'  Two words - The Holocaust."
So Jews should be forbidden entry on the grounds of Psalm 137:8-9.
"I seriously doubt that gay refugees are interested in that, given that they are fleeing anti-gay religions and cultures. Andrew --------------- what are these  anti-gay religions they are fleeing? Do these anti gay religions not also exist in Canada?"
So headlines that include 'dangerous faggots' 'renegade jews' or 'muslin rape culture' aren't racist???
Oh well. Muslims doing what Muslims do.  Why do they hate each other so?
So all the preaching  in the mosque about extermination of Jews doesn't bother him?
"How is this any different from the Kentucky clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples?  If your religious beliefs are so against the gay community, then you had better not get a job or into a profession that is obligated to serve ALL people."

"His letter really is the definition of intolerance, a basket full of deplorables no? I would propose that far more Americans identify as Christians than 'Liberals'. That's a lot of hate and moral superiority from the left. Nothing new......."
I'm not sure you understand what I'm saying at all.   1. What laws are you referring to? 2. How am I being permissive of sexual misconduct over one orientation or the other? I've made it pretty clear that gay or straight: sexual misconduct is wrong.
"Morality is always arguable . . .'  Let me understand:  The morality of, say, exterminating 6 millions Jews is arguable?"
To imagine that the action of Baird and Harper had on recent events in Iran is quite delusional..
And making sure there's plenty of tranny solders and they can be assigned to the new Space Cadet Corps where they can be called Star Ship Trannies.

"I have no regard for Trump, but not to worry, the left wing media will shamelessly shill for Clinton. No less than the Canadian media shills for the left."
There were probably a lack of trans gender people so our government boycotted the meeting

"Lol, i love when people talk like this, not raging at you gary, but. It shows how ignorant you are. You can't just become transgender. There is soooo much you have to do, and prove. Years, even decades can pass before everything is done."
The following countries BAN any Israeli Jew from even entering their country: Syria Iran Iraq Yemen Libya  Algeria Bangladesh Brunei Kuwait Lebanon Malaysia Oman Pakistan Sudan Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates

"her beliefs are misogynistic, anti-semitic, anti-gay, and anti-science so her hurt feelings really dont mean that much to me."
Considering a govt can get elected with only 39% of the popular vote eliminating the views of 20% of the population is just stupid.  Transgendered people represent less than 1% of the population so from your comment they can be ignored as well.
"Being a Mob Boss is one thing, ordering the murder, extortion, prostitution, money laundering, drug dealing, et'c are sins.  Being a homosexual man or woman is not a sin."
"Peterson is pretty clearly a bigot - not because of refusal to use the 31 customized pronouns, but because of his public statements that transgender people don't deserve to be recognized as existing at all."
"Exactly. The US passed the Magnitsky Act, and they're at the table. Dion simply caved and cravenly sucked up to Putin. End of story."
And we also have the duty to avoid prostituting our Catholic identity by appeals to phony dialogue that mask an abdication of our moral witness.'  (Archbishop Chaput 2009)  What a nasty comment!
"Maybe if the Democrats would stop pandering to every identifiable special interest group they would have a chance to be seen as serious people. When your message is aimed mostly at people who care about transgender bathroom access and microagressions, you are going to lose more than you gain."
"Terrorism is a modest, immediate threat to the United States.' Tell that to the 911, Boston Marathon, and San Bernardino families. The writer is a racist, blaming Jews. Shame on the RG for allowing this Holocaust-supporting writer to express his hatred."
I think a lot of so called Christians missed those verses.  They are more into the prosperity gospel.
Probably not so much a transgender agenda as much as a higher-ratings-play agenda.
When will the Iroquois nation pay back the surviving Huron natives for the genocides of the 18th Century? That reparation and reconciliation should be worth a few billion by now in today's money.
"But more can always be done'  I agree, I would like to see the 'peaceful' Muslim community band together and create a revised Quran, that deletes the passages that advocate violence and killing. I feel confident that Alah would not object, given that ISIS has even been attacking other Muslims."

It is you who are mocking Christ and His Church by attempting to separate Him from his Church. Trent rescued Christ's Church from the errors of Protestantism yet you want to drag us back there again.
So another gobbet of bile as a substitute for any kind of argument - well done

"Is this a GOP party fundraiser or one of Pence's gay conversion clinics? Don't get me wrong, I think both are equally horrible and a huge waste of time and money ...."
It is not a Muslim ban.  It affects non-Muslims also from the six countries.  And 90% of world's Muslims from fifty odd countries are still allowed. But the lying media continue  jihad against President Trump on so called 'Muslim ban'
"One yearns for a time when Canada as a nation can concentrate on what we can achieve together, all of us working towards a future where we have one equal citizenship for all."

"Canada has more than enough challenges right here at home. While I feel for the Chechnyan gays, they are simply not a priority for our tax dollars."
The prime minister (much less the cabinet) can not be elected directly because ours is a responsible government system. You'd have to change the constitution absolutely entirely if you wanted presidential-style elections.
Why to care about birth rate (which is the major characteristics of good government) if the government of Canada is more concerned with expanding homosexuality and immigration?
Surprisingly there is mention of any dialogue about US access to Canada's transgender washrooms.
What a waste of time this guy is...very inexperienced in he needs a reality check..
"I've never met anyone who blamed their lack of success on 'nasty females, queers, coloured  folks'....obviously we move in different circles."
Go cry to mommy.
We're not distinct from America. Get serious. They should erase that border so we can align our economic interests instead of Canada being the backwater that it is. Grow up.
Merely proof that the Roman Empire policy of ' Bread and Circuses' for the proletariat was sufficient governance .....
"I would like to attend a gay, white supremacist wedding, just out of curiosity.'  So..you think it's impossible for a homosexual to be racist? You don't get out much..do you? The Little Guy"
Are you so naïve that you think the Muslims in this country really care what we think?  They just up their birth rate and bide their time.
"for all of you who dont know, Michelle Obama was born a male.  She is the first transgender spouse of any president.  Joan rivers was killed during THROAT surgery after speaking out about this."
These foul bast@#ds traffic in blatant lies and outrageous conspiracy theories and pretend to be Christian. My god but we are in the midst of some dangerous times. When people can no longer separated the wheat from the chaff we no longer have a democracy.
when you confuse  Anti-Muslim hate for  Anti-Radical Islam hate therein lies the confusion
"Instead of restrooms, we'll only have porta potties installed.  Problem solved.  Transgender friendly restrooms."
Check ignition ....and may God's love be with you
The liberal FAKE NEWS media doesn't want to report about the anti-semitism directed at conservative jews.  Oh no. That doesn't help their neo nazi narrative.

"After January 20th, Muslims will become (to use your favourite term) untouchables in the US. Not allowed to use schools, airports, hotels, restaurants along with their white counterparts.   Kind of like African Americans had to go through segregation. Bet you support that too!"
Headline.............'Konrad should show a little understanding of reality!'
"What if it was a child molester?' Then you would be a priest and be covered?  However, the catholic church has harbored 1000s of these ppl"
Is the Pope Catholic?  Of course gun reforms will help curb gun violance.  Look at Australia.  Stupid to just continue to ignore this problem so that big business can make a few bucks.
maybe.  this is a continuation of a robo call to Jewish centres throughout North America.  Not sure why but I would suggest Trump has unleashed the worst in people.
"Oh a trans-woman would be the wet dream. Its called 'intersectional victimhood', wherein you get to claim victim status for more than one thing. I wonder if you can get merit badges to sew into your vest, to show how many ways the patriarchy oppresses you?"
My wife is Chinese and I'm White. This fact is almost never brought up between us. My wife told me the other day she forgets that I'm not Chinese. What goes on in these bitter people's minds?
threatening a person and name calling are substantively different. while both are uncivil only one is criminal
"Very, very funny and really reflects Mr. Harper's weird way in which he is unable to answer any question given to him. I can see that 4thot is already upset at the accurate representation of our Prime Minister."
A Russian Ambassador is murdered by a Turkish Islamist and already the press in both Turkey and Russia are blaming the West in general and the US in particular.
"But Trump will appoint judges who will protect fetuses and stop gay marriage, so it's all good - or so we've been told."
Tell that to the Ukrainian Catholics and the other Eastern Catholic churches that do not use Latin and never have.
Psychology is post-christian-rubbish.
"How nice of Wohlforth and the Dispatch----they allow us to comment on this story , but to heck with what we think concerning his gay issue story .  Wohlforth and the Dispatch are against and ban free speech when matters dear to their heart are written about."
"Knowing Donald Trump, he will ban Muslims from carrying laptops onto US-bound planes..."
"Of course 'all thy sons' should be dropped. It's 2016.'All of us,' though, is not very poetic 'All our hearts' is better: True patriot love in all our hearts command."
the Nazi and the Vichy French were involved with the killing of jews
ACPeds?  You mean the politically-motivated anti-LGBT hate group that's a fraction of the size of the well-respected American Academy of Pediatrics that supports trans kids?  Oh.  Those 'experts' in damaging children's health.
We must tolerate what we regard as barbaric cultural practices that do not break any laws. Thus we should tolerate the burka but not 'family honour' violence. So an immigrant who admits to having a strong sense of family honour should be screened.
"Yes, let's end the insanity!  No more trans people! No more boys kissing boys! No more rock n roll music! Let's get back to the good ol' days of the 1950s!"
"Oh, I see, Alexvega... so, In other words, guilty until proven innocent, hmm? Yup... quite simple. Except that our justice system works on the reverse premise. Next..."
"Portapotties are transgender public-use toilets, as are airplane lavatories. All public use toilets should be one-at-time, one room, one-holers. People who think about sex in  a public toilet room are super gross."
Khadr is a real Canadian Hero after undergoing torture at the hands of the Civilized Americans and spending years of illegal incarceration at their offshore Black Hole prison in Cuba.
Think if Justin trudeau was PM he would make the rounds of all the Arab states ring kissing.
Vatican II was supposed to 'fix' the product and the Church went from good to bad.
Slanderous comment from The Great Malumba.
I'm not referring to the CBC as an entity but what it accomplish in connecting us as an nation.

"You mean that laughable double standard where 'blacks' and 'Jews' have historically oppressed 'whites'? Yeah, so laughable."
He refused to design ANY kind of wedding cake from the moment he heard the wedding was for a gay couple. This is all about religious conservatives wanting the absolute right to discriminate against gay couples while still being protected by the civil rights laws from discrimination against them.
"SJWs at U of T have made laughing at trans-gender pronouns an actual criminal act,   punishable  by arrest, imprisonment  and fines."
I assume the transgender athletes are all taking hormones and/or steroids?  I don't know how you can call the Olympics clean when different people have different rules. . Not that they are clean in any event ... but they don't seem to even try to appear clean anymore
"She has the same right as every other person writing editorials in this paper.  Why would she have any less right becuase she happens to be a Muslim?    You probably also believe that women belong in the kitchen, you misogynist bigot."
What's weird is the must be gay accusation only plays to right wingers.
"Evidently, Layla is perfectly fine with the LGBTQ community not being represented in any manner.  But fortunately, the Supreme Court is not."
"What, you think guys with effeminate characteristics like Martin and other gay men are new in society?"
You might recall that six men were shot to death recently while at prayer in a mosque because they were Muslim.
"It looks like the K brand poverty pimps just write other columns occasionally here at the Globe ... giving us a 'balanced' perspective. Wonder if they are paid for their columns, and where that money goes?"

"Republican party FILTHY w super fakey 'christians'.  They'll stab in you in the back for a buck, wave a flag, then kick you in the face ..."
I'm much-more concerned with her wardrobe.  Where does she get those outfits?  Doesn't she know any gay people?
Who is this evil Catholic woman enterpreneur who does  not pay her workers properly? Can we name some names?
wow you are a fool
"It's also about time that you and your parents and relatives who have settled on lands belonging to the native peoples begin to evacuate and leave just as the UN resolution demands of Jews living in the West Bank. Get moving, you racist hypocrite!"
I think it is time for Justin to name to the court the first trans indigenous person...why?  Because it's 2017 silly....
The Fleur de Lis is a religious symbol.
Now I understand why you support Trump so fervently. You are incapable of logical or rational thought.
Not that long ago that Catholics had to cover their heads at mass (remember the ridiculous hanky thing?)! Most of the Muslim women I know do not cover their hair- let us not get crazy about this.
"I include you Elaine in my nightly prayers, I pray that everyone of your Grandchildren is healthy, happy and gay."
"Close the MSM down, get rid of the jews that run them..they are the problem"
"Oh please. This story is over 70 years old.  What about a write up on at least one Jew saving an Arab from their own government's continual holocaust of Palestinians happening today? No, never in the G&M."
"Oh yes it can!  Bishops do it all the time!  The surest way to suppress dogma is to EGNORE it, as the hierarchy has long been doing in reference to the Catholic clergy sex abuse crisis.  Did they skip Catholicism 101, or what?"
Complaining that you might get blown up on the way to vacation is islamophobic.
Are the Muslim women protesting Islam and Muhammad for relegating them to lower status than men?
"Because gays make up a large segment of the priesthood? Because sexual predisposition, by definition, does not appear only in certain categories of faith ?"
"What is your source for this statement since there are many examples of abuse of females, Marie being a prime example? Since bishops and cardinals used to be priests, how many are gay? A Goggle search will show many of them have offended against both male and female children."
GAR385 Less Americans voted for Trump than voted for Clinton. -------------- FEWER Americans voted for Trump than voted for Clinton. It would not hurt to bring back teaching grammar
"Knew he wasn't a white Christian, or much of an American. When Americans do this this we use all kinds of guns, guns and more guns and lots of ammo. This guy clearly wasn't fully assimilated into our society."
"A nation must have common values that bind people together. Canadians will need to have this discussion, but I can't see any existing party brave enough to suggest this."
Fine--why is he not condemning politicians --especially 'Catholic' politicians who support abortion with the same veracity?
"This is a perfect example of the RG mocking Christianity..... by not making a simple grammar edit from 'feast'  to 'festival', they maliciously embarrass an obvious ESL christian.  Pathetic.  Any display of Christianity in Eugene nowadays will get you tased and jailed by the PC brownshirts.  /s"
the Globes painful attempts to avoid the word Islam  ... what a clown show
"Just as Bill Clinton claimed to be the first black president, Obama will claim to be the first trans president"
"Homophobia isn't fear of homosexual people, it's fear of homosexual feelings/attractions the person has inside their own mind. Thor has a semantic point."
Everyone in that crowd who was carrying tiki torches and chanting 'Jew will not replace us!' and 'blood and soil!' is a terrorist. Do your research.
"Dump the monarchy, elect a president (keep calling him GG if you wish) and give that president-GG power and authority to protect parliament from government and PMO abuses. Oh, and dump the senmate."
The Jewish circumcision of male infants could be called 'barbaric'. And we're ashamed of the time we didn't welcome them here.
"The KKK and Nazis hate Jews. Trump is surrounded by Jews. His daughter is a convert and his son in law is Orthodox Jewish. Trump's grandchildren are Jewish. Before you go there, Trump also has a black friend named Dr. Ben Carson."
"No, I am not a sore/poor loser.  I think this so-called genital grabbing president has expressed bigoted views, backed people like Bannon, who hates Jews, and is a Putin lover.  Instead of being a unifying this country he is dividing it even more."
"They should win - - as long as they can put shock-collars on the WildRose fascists to stop them spouting-off inane anachronisms; denouncing and hating: women, homosexuals. environmentalists, non-white Canadians, labour laws, and any person or activity that doesn't increase the profits of U.S. and foreign oil companies..."
Is an 'independent mind' at liberty to breach a 'sacred trust'? -- especially a Pope's. We'll see if Benedict XVI is capable of producing more theological masterpieces in the future.
Yes - Canada is based on the fundamental principle of good government.
I guess that was a primary reason Canada didn't allow Jewish refugees during World War Two. It was very hard to cross check with Nazi records if any of the applicants was a mass murderer or a judge!
"Yes, I did know that. But it's a tradition for us to ask presidential candidates this silly question. In past years, it's elicited the only non-scripted moment. Should I not have asked him because he is Jewish? No, I don't think so."

It's just the staff writers and their multiple sockpuppet accounts that insult and harass you all the time.
"1) because of Islam, which is an all or nothing, fight to the death philosophy 2)  because of Islam, which is an all or nothing, fight to the death philosophy"
Tell that to the Ethiopian Sephardic Jews

"In an attempt to be civil, I find great difficulty with the Jew Bernstein.  In my opinion, he has always be and will continue to be scum."
They should be worried. The liberalism in Europe has allowed for the emergence of another fascist ideology - political Islam. People have every right to be worried and the only party willing to talk about this issue is the right wing.
I'm holding out for the Transgender doll with mix and match body parts.

"We all know your views on gay men.  Though I have to wonder, how does the life choices(which it's not a choice) of gay men effect you.  Are you at risk for HIV infection from either a gay man, or injection drugs?"
